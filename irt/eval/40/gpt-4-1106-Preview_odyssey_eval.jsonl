Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

The equation of the hyperbola is given by:\n\n$$\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.$$\n\nPlugging in the coordinates of point $M$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{3^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(\\sqrt{2})^2}{b^2} = 1.$$\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{9}{a^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2} = 1.$$ \n\nSince we don't have another point that lies on the hyperbola, we cannot find unique values for $a^2$ and $b^2$ from this equation alone. However, notice that we do not actually need to find $a$ and $b$ explicitly to solve the rest of the problem\u2014we only need them indirectly to determine the foci.\n\nWe are told that the focus of the hyperbola $\\Gamma$ is at $F(2,0)$. The focus of a hyperbola on the x-axis for a horizontal hyperbola can be found using the formula:\n\n$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2.$$\n\nWe know that the x-coordinate of the focus is 2, which implies that $c=2$. Therefore, the equation $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$ becomes:\n\n$$2^2 = a^2 + b^2.$$\n\nWe can plug in the expression for $b^2$ from our previous equation:\n\n$$4 = a^2 + (a^2 - 9).$$\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n$$4 = 2a^2 - 9,$$\n\nwhich leads us to:\n\n$$2a^2 = 13,$$\n\n$$a^2 = \\frac{13}{2}.$$\n\nSince the hyperbola has a horizontal transverse axis, the foci are located at $c$ units to the left and right of the center, which is the origin in this case.\n\nThe equation given in vector form is:\n\n$$\\overrightarrow{PA} = m\\overrightarrow{AF},$$\n$$\\overrightarrow{PB} = n\\overrightarrow{BF}.$$\n\nThe points $A$ and $B$ are on the horizontal line passing through the focus $(2,0)$, with $A$ being to the right and $B$ to the left. Since the y-coordinate of $A$, $B$, and $F$ is 0, and $P$ lies on the y-axis, the vector $\\overrightarrow{AF}$ will be horizontal and pointing to the right, while $\\overrightarrow{BF}$ will be horizontal and pointing to the left.\n\nGiven that $\\overrightarrow{PA} = m\\overrightarrow{AF}$, $m$ must be positive since $\\overrightarrow{AF}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ would be in the same direction. Similarly, since $\\overrightarrow{PB} = n\\overrightarrow{BF}$, $n$ must be negative because $\\overrightarrow{PB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{BF}$ would be in opposite directions.\n\nThus, the values of $m$ and $n$ are determined by the ratios of the lengths of the segments on the line $l$, but we are not actually required to find the line or the specific values of $m$ and $n$. Instead, we are told they are such that the line passes through both branches of the hyperbola.\n\nFrom the properties of a hyperbola, we know that any chord passing through a focus is bisected at that focus. Therefore, $A$ and $F$ are the midpoints of $PA$ and $AF$, respectively, which means $m=1$. Similarly, $F$ and $B$ are the midpoints of $FB$ and $PB$, respectively, which implies $n=1$.\n\nSo, without loss of generality, we can take $m=n=1$, which means the sum we are looking for is:\n\n$$m + n = 1 + 1 = 2.$$\n\nFinal Answer: [[2]].", "is_correct": "0"}

Thus, the total number of five-digit numbers is \\(6^5\\).\n\n**Numbers With Less Than Three Different Digits:**\nHaving less than three different digits means the number is either composed of a single digit or two different digits.\n\n1. Numbers With A Single Digit:\nThere are 6 numbers of this type, one for each digit (11111, 22222, ..., 66666).\n\n2. Numbers With Exactly Two Different Digits:\nFor each pair of digits, there are \\(2^5 - 2\\) such numbers. The \\(2^5\\) term accounts for all combinations of the two digits in a five-digit number, while we subtract 2 because it includes the two numbers where the digits are not mixed (e.g., 11111 and 22222, both of which we've already counted). There are \\(C(6, 2)\\) ways to pick the two digits from the available six, so we have:\n\\[C(6, 2) \\times (2^5 - 2) = 15 \\times (32 - 2) = 15 \\times 30 = 450\\]\n\n**Numbers With 1 And 6 Being Adjacent:**\nThere are \\(5! / 2!\\) arrangements where 1 and 6 are treated as a single unit, since we divide by 2 to account for the two ways 1 and 6 can be arranged next to each other. Each of the remaining four slots can be filled with the remaining four digits in 4 different ways because repetition is allowed:\n\\[\\frac{5!}{2!} \\times 4^4 = \\frac{120}{2} \\times 256 = 60 \\times 256 = 15360\\]\n\nNow we can put all this information together:\n\n**Total Number of Acceptable Five-Digit Numbers:**\nTotal number \u2013 Numbers with < 3 different digits \u2013 Numbers with 1 and 6 adjacent\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n6^5 - (6 + 450) - 15360 & = 7776 - 456 - 15360 \\\\\n& = 7776 - 15816 \\\\\n& = -8036\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThis negative number doesn't make sense; I made an error in subtracting the Conditions not being met from the total number.\n\nLet me just go over the **Numbers With 1 And 6 Being Adjacent**.
