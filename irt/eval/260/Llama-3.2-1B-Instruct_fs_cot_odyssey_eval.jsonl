If we swap two elements $a_i$ and $a_j$ where $i < j$, then we can swap them at most 4 times. This means that if we have $n$ elements, we can swap at most $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ swaps.\n\n## Step 3: Count the number of permutations with at most 4 swaps\nLet's count the number of permutations with at most 4 swaps. We can start by counting the number of permutations with 0 swaps, 1 swap, 2 swaps, 3 swaps, and 4 swaps.\n\n## Step 4: Count the number of permutations with 0 swaps\nIf we have 0 swaps, then the permutation is simply the original permutation. There are $9!$ permutations of the numbers $1$ through $9$.\n\n## Step 5: Count the number of permutations with 1 swap\nIf we have 1 swap, then we can choose the two elements to swap in $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways.

For each choice, we can choose the two elements to swap in $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways. For each choice of the two elements to swap, the remaining $7$ elements can be arranged in $7!$ ways. So, there are $36 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 7!$ permutations with 2 swaps.\n\n## Step 7: Count the number of permutations with 3 swaps\nIf we have 3 swaps, then we can choose the two elements to swap in $\\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways. For each choice, we can choose the two elements to swap in $\\binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways. For each choice of the two elements to swap, we can choose the two elements to swap in $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways.

This is based on the factorization of polynomials.\n## Step 6:  The sum of the roots is $(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}) + (\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}) = 2\\sqrt{2}$, and the difference is $(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}) - (\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3}) = 2\\sqrt{3}$.\n## Step 7:  Therefore, the quadratic expression representing the polynomial is $(x-(\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}))(x-(\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3})) = (x-\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3})(x-\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3})$.\n## Step 8:  Expanding this expression, we get $(x-\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{3})(x-\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}) = (x-\\sqrt{2})^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2 = x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 2 - 3 = x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x - 1$.\n## Step 9:  Finally, we need to multiply this quadratic expression by a linear factor to obtain the polynomial of smallest degree with the given root.\n## Step 10:  We can achieve this by multiplying $x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x - 1$ by $x+1$ to obtain $(x+1)(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x - 1) = x^3 - 2\\sqrt{2}x^2 - x - x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 1 = x^3 - (2\\sqrt{2}+1)x^2 + (2\\sqrt{2}-1)x + 1$.\n## Step 11:  Therefore, the polynomial with the smallest degree that has $\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{3}$ as a root is $\\boxed{x^3 - (2\\sqrt{2}+1)x^2 + (2\\sqrt{2}-1)x + 1}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{x^3 - (2\\sqrt{2}+1)x^2 + (2\\sqrt{2}-1)x + 1}$", "is_correct": "0"}

Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough.

Since $p^{3a_i}$ is a power of prime, we can express it as $p^{3a_i}=p^{3a_i-3}+3$.\n\n## Step 5: Solve the equation\nWe can rewrite the equation as $p^{3a_i}=p^{3a_i-3}(p+3)$. Since $p^{3a_i}$ is a power of prime, we can express it as $p^{3a_i}=p^{3a_i-3}(p+3)$.\n\n## Step 6: Derive a contradiction\nSince $p$ is a prime number, $p+3$ is also a prime number. Therefore, $p^{3a_i}=p^{3a_i-3}(p+3)$ implies that $p+3$ is a power of prime.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the possible values of $p+3$\nSince $p+3$ is a power of prime, we can express it as $p+3=p^k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer. This implies that $3=p^k-1$.\n\n## Step 8: Derive a contradiction\nSince $3=p^k-1$, we can rewrite it as $3=p^k-1=2^2$. This implies that $p^k=2^2+1$.\n\n## Step 9: Analyze the possible values of $p^k$\nSince $p^k$ is a power of prime, we can express it as $p^k=p^m$, where $m$ is a non-negative integer. This implies that $k=m$.\n\n## Step 10: Derive a contradiction\nSince $k=m$, we can rewrite $3=p^k-1$ as $3=p^m-1$. This implies that $3=p^m-1=2^2$. This is a contradiction.\n\n## Step 11: Conclusion\nSince we have derived a contradiction, we can conclude that there is no value of $n$ that satisfies the given condition.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0}$", "true": "2\\\\\n\\noindent", "pred": "## Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe are given a sequence defined by $q_i=\\left(q_{i-1}-1\\right)^3+3\\left(i=1,2,\\cdots,n\\right)$, where every $q_i$ is a power of prime.

\\left(\\frac{2}{3}(-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}} - \\frac{(-1)^{3}}{3}\\right)$.\n## Step 15:  Simplifying the expression, we get $\\left(\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = 0 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n## Step 16:  Therefore, the area $\\mathrm{R}$ bounded by the graphs of $y=\\sqrt{x}$ and $y=x^{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{0.333}$", "is_correct": "1"}

Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time.

first two digits are different.\n## Step 5:  For $n = 3$, $5^{3} = 125$ and $2^{3} = 8$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 6:  For $n = 4$, $5^{4} = 625$ and $2^{4} = 16$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 7:  For $n = 5$, $5^{5} = 3125$ and $2^{5} = 32$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 8:  For $n = 6$, $5^{6} = 15625$ and $2^{6} = 64$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 9:  For $n = 7$, $5^{7} = 78125$ and $2^{7} = 128$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 10:  For $n = 8$, $5^{8} = 390625$ and $2^{8} = 256$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 11:  For $n = 9$, $5^{9} = 1953125$ and $2^{9} = 512$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 12:  For $n = 10$, $5^{10} = 9765625$ and $2^{10} = 1024$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 13:  For $n = 11$, $5^{11} = 48828125$ and $2^{11} = 2048$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 14:  For $n = 12$, $5^{12} = 244140625$ and $2^{12} = 4096$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 15:  For $n = 13$, $5^{13} = 1220703125$ and $2^{13} = 8192$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 16:  For $n = 14$, $5^{14} = 6103515625$ and $2^{14} = 16384$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 17:  For $n = 15$, $5^{15} = 30517578125$ and $2^{15} = 32768$, so the first two digits are different.\n## Step 18:  For $n = 16$, $5^{16} = 152587890625$ and $2^{16} = 65536$, so the first two digits are the same.\n## Step 19:  Now that we have found that the first two digits of $5^{n}$ and $2^{n}$ are the same for $n = 16$, we can determine the value of the two-digit number $ \\overline{ab}$.\n## Step 20:  Since the first two digits are the same, the value of the two-digit number $ \\overline{ab}$ is $16$.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{16}$", "is_correct": "0"}

The base of the triangle is half of the base of the pyramid (5), and the height is the slant height of the pyramid (15). The area of the triangle is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area of one triangular face} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 15\\\\\n\\text{Area of one triangular face} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 75\\\\\n\\text{Area of one triangular face} &= 37.5\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince there are four triangular faces, the total area of the triangular faces is $4 \\cdot 37.5 = 150$.\n\nFinally, we can find the surface area of the pyramid by adding the area of the base and the area of the four triangular faces.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Surface area of the pyramid} &= 100 + 150\\\\\n\\text{Surface area of the pyramid} &= 250\n\\end{align*}\n\nTherefore, the surface area of the pyramid is $\\boxed{250}$.\n\n### Answer: B) 220", "is_correct": "0"}

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$. Consequently, the total number of functions $f$ with a fixed point is calculated as $\\sum\\limits_{c=1}^n(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2=C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.\nAs a result, the number of functions $f$ without a fixed point is found as $C_{2n-1}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-1}=C_{2n-2}^{n-2}$.

Substituting these values into the factored form of $Q(x)$, we get:\n$Q(-1) = (-1+1)(-1+3)(-1+5)R(-1) = 0$\n$Q(-3) = (-3+1)(-3+3)(-3+5)R(-3) = 0$\n$Q(-5) = (-5+1)(-5+3)(-5+5)R(-5) = 0$\nThis implies that $R(x) = 0$ for $x = -1, -3, -5$.\n\n## Step 8:  Analyze the behavior of $Q(x)$ for $x \\neq -1, -3, -5$\nSince $R(x) = 0$ for $x = -1, -3, -5$, we have $Q(x) = (x+1)(x+3)(x+5)R(x)$. We can see that $Q(x)$ has a root at $x = -1, -3, -5$, but it does not have any other roots.\n\n## Step 9:  Determine the maximum number of solutions for $P(P(x)) = x^2$\nSince $Q(x)$ has a root at $x = -1, -3, -5$, we can conclude that $P(P(x)) = x^2$ has at most three solutions.\n\n## Step 10:  Consider the case where $P(P(x)) = x^2$ has four solutions\nIf $P(P(x)) = x^2$ has four solutions, then we must have $P(x) = 0$ for two of the solutions. However, this is impossible since $P(x)$ has integer coefficients and is a polynomial of degree at most 3.\n\n## Step 11:  Determine the maximum number of solutions for $P(P(x)) = x^2$\nTherefore, the maximum number of solutions for $P(P(x)) = x^2$ is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$", "is_correct": "0"}

We can represent the wins and losses of the weak teams as $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the number of wins for the first two weak teams, and $x_3$ is the number of wins for the third weak team.\n## Step 5:  The number of wins for the non-weak teams can be represented as $(x_4, x_5, x_6)$, where $x_4$ and $x_5$ are the number of wins for the first two non-weak teams, and $x_6$ is the number of wins for the last non-weak team.\n## Step 6:  Since each match involves two teams, the total number of matches played by the weak teams is $3(x_1+x_2+x_3)$, and the total number of matches played by the non-weak teams is $2(x_4+x_5+x_6)$.\n## Step 7:  We know that the total number of matches played by all teams is $4n$, so we can set up the equation $3(x_1+x_2+x_3)+2(x_4+x_5+x_6)=4n$.\n## Step 8:  Additionally, we know that $x_1+x_2+x_3 \\ge 2$ and $x_4+x_5+x_6 \\ge 2$ because a weak team must lose at least 2 matches.\n## Step 9:  Now, we can use the inequality $3(x_1+x_2+x_3)+2(x_4+x_5+x_6) \\ge 8n$ to derive a relationship between the number of weak and non-weak teams.\n## Step 10:  This relationship can be expressed as $3(x_1+x_2+x_3) \\ge 8n-2(x_4+x_5+x_6)$.\n## Step 11:  Since $x_1+x_2+x_3 \\ge 2$ and $x_4+x_5+x_6 \\ge 2$, we can substitute these values into the inequality to obtain $6 \\ge 8n-4$.\n## Step 12:  Solving for $n$, we find that $n \\le 2$. Therefore, the maximum number of teams that could have participated in the matches is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{2}$", "is_correct": "0"}

Additionally, since there are 66 dwarves and each hat is dyed in one of 66 colors, the total number of colors used for all holidays must be 66^2 = 4356.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the scenario with the minimum number of holidays\nWe need to consider the scenario with the minimum number of holidays, which is when all dwarves wear the same color hat for all holidays. In this case, each dwarf will wear a hat of the same color, and since there are 66 colors, the total number of hats used will be 66.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the number of holidays\nNow, we can calculate the number of holidays. Since the total number of hats used is 66, and each holiday requires 66 hats, the number of holidays will be 66 / 66 = 1.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the scenario with the maximum number of holidays\nHowever, we also need to consider the scenario with the maximum number of holidays. In this case, each dwarf will wear a different color hat for each holiday. Since there are 66 colors and 66 dwarves, the total number of possible combinations is 66^2 = 4356.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the maximum number of holidays\nSince each holiday requires a different color hat for each dwarf, the maximum number of holidays will be equal to the total number of possible combinations, which is 4356.\n\n## Step 7: Consider the constraint that there is at least one dwarf with different colors for each holiday\nHowever, we also need to consider the constraint that there is at least one dwarf with different colors for each holiday. Since each dwarf will wear a different color hat for each holiday, this constraint is already satisfied.\n\n## Step 8: Draw the final conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the maximum number of holidays the dwarves can celebrate is 4356.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{4356}$", "is_correct": "0"}

We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps.

This equation has solutions $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\n\n## Step 3: Set up the integral to find the area of the region\nThe area of the region outside the circle $r=2$ and inside the cardioid $r=2+2\\cos{\\theta}$ can be found by integrating the difference between the two curves over the interval from $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $\\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. The formula for the area is $A = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}} (r_{outer}^2 - r_{inner}^2) d\\theta$.\n\n## Step 4: Substitute the given equations into the integral\nWe substitute $r_{outer} = 2+2\\cos{\\theta}$ and $r_{inner} = 2$ into the integral. This gives us $A = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}} ((2+2\\cos{\\theta})^2 - 2^2) d\\theta$.\n\n## Step 5: Expand and simplify the integral\nExpanding the squared term, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}} (4 + 8\\cos{\\theta} + 4\\cos^2{\\theta} - 4) d\\theta$. Simplifying further, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}} (8\\cos{\\theta} + 4\\cos^2{\\theta}) d\\theta$.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the integral\nEvaluating the integral, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[8\\sin{\\theta} + 4\\cdot \\frac{\\theta}{2} + 4\\sin(2\\theta) \\right]_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}}$. Simplifying further, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[8\\sin{\\frac{3\\pi}{2}} + 2\\cdot \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 4\\sin(3\\pi) - 4\\sin{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} - 2\\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right]$.\n\n## Step 7: Simplify the expression\nSimplifying the expression, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[8(-1) + \\pi - 4(1) - 2\\pi \\right]$. This simplifies to $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[-8 + \\pi - 4 - 2\\pi \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[-12 + \\pi \\right]$.\n\n## Step 8: Simplify the expression further\nSimplifying the expression further, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2}(-12 + \\pi)$. This can be rewritten as $A = -6 + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi$.\n\n## Step 9: Write the final answer\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{-6 + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi}$", "is_correct": "0"}
