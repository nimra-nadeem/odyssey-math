Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

12t + 3t^2 - 64 + 128t - 64t^2 = 3$.\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n$-61t^2 + 116t - 59 = 0$.\nFactoring this quadratic equation, we get:\n$(-t + 1)(61t - 59) = 0$.\nSo, $t = 1$ or $t = \\frac{59}{61}$.\nSince $x_0 > 0$ and $x_0 \\neq \\sqrt{3}$, we can eliminate the solution $t = 1$.\nTherefore, $t = \\frac{59}{61}$.\nSubstituting this value of t into the equation $x_0^2 - \\frac{16t^2}{3} = 1$, we get:\n$x_0^2 - \\frac{16(\\frac{59}{61})^2}{3} = 1$.\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n$x_0^2 - \\frac{16 \\cdot 3481}{3721} = 1$.\nMultiplying both sides by 3721 to eliminate the fraction, we get:\n$3721x_0^2 - 16 \\cdot 3481 = 3721$.\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n$3721x_0^2 = 16 \\cdot 3481 + 3721$.\nDividing both sides by 3721, we get:\n$x_0^2 = \\frac{16 \\cdot 3481 + 3721}{3721}$.\nSimplifying this equation, we have:\n$x_0^2 = \\frac{55696 + 3721}{3721}$.\n$x_0^2 = \\frac{59417}{3721}$.\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$x_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{59417}{3721}}$.\nSimplifying this expression, we have:\n$x_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{59417}}{\\sqrt{3721}}$.\n$x_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{59417}}{61}$.\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{59417}}{61}}$.The answer is: \\frac{\\sqrt{59417}}{61}", "is_correct": "0"}

Since the line passes through the right focus, its slope is given by the derivative of the hyperbola at the right branch:\n\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}$\n\nAt the right branch, $y > 0$, so the slope of the line is:\n\n$m = \\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}$\n\nNow, we can find the equations of the lines $l$ passing through the right focus $F(2,0)$:\n\n$y - 0 = \\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}(x - 2)$\n\n$y = \\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}(x - 2)$\n\nSince the line crosses the right branch of the hyperbola at points $A$ and $B$, we can find the coordinates of these points by solving the system of equations formed by the line and the hyperbola:\n\n$\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$\n\n$y = \\frac{b^2x}{a^2y}(x - 2)$\n\nNow, we can find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ by solving this system of equations.

Furthermore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $b | \\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n$, $b | \\alpha_{n+1} - 2(n+1)\\alpha^{n+1}$, and $b | \\alpha_{n+2} - 2(n+2)\\alpha^{n+2}$. Combining these with $\\alpha_{n+2} = \\alpha_{n+1} + \\alpha_n$ and $b = 2\\alpha - 1$ being odd, we get\n\t\\[ b | (n+2)a^{n+2} - (n+1)a^{n+1} - na^n. \\]\n\tSince $(b, a) = 1$, we have $b | (n+2)a^2 - (n+1)a - n$.\n\t\\item By setting $n$ to $n+1$ in the above equation, we get $b | (n+3)a^2 - (n+2)a - (n+1)$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields $b | a^2 - a - 1$, i.e., $2a - 1 | a^2 - a - 1$. So, $2a - 1 | 2a^2 - 2a - 2$. Since $2\\alpha^2 \\equiv \\alpha \\pmod{2\\alpha - 1}$, we have $2\\alpha - 1 | -\\alpha - 2$ and $2\\alpha - 1 | -2\\alpha - 4$. Thus, $2\\alpha - 1 | -5$, implying $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ or $5$. However, $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ leads to $b = \\alpha$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $2\\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\t\\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n)$. For $n = 1, 2$, we have $\\alpha_1 = 1$ and $\\alpha_2 = \\alpha + \\beta = 1$, so $\\alpha_1 - 2 \\times 3 = -5$ and $\\alpha_2 - 2 \\times 2 \\times 3^2 = -35$, which confirms the condition. Assuming the condition holds for $n = k, k+1$, we can prove it for $n = k+2$ as well. Hence, $\\left(a, b\\right) = \\left(3, 5\\right)$ satisfies the conditions.\n\\end{enumerate}", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition", "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct_response": " We are given that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the roots of the equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$.

It is known that some people are friends (friendship is mutual), and each person has at least one friend. The rules of the game are as follows: each person first writes down a positive real number, and the $n$ positive real numbers written by everyone are all different; then, for each person, if he has $k$ friends, he divides the number he wrote by $k$, and tells all his friends the result obtained; finally, each person writes down the sum of all the numbers he hears. The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "2\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.\n\nLet the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$.\n\nConsider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n)$.\n\nUnder this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \\leq i \\leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time.

If all 51 people fail to guess correctly, it implies that the numbers from 1 to 51 are all in the last 49 positions, which is clearly contradictory. For 50 people, the permutation arranged by the host can be constructed as follows: fill in numbers from 1 to 100 in the positions 1 to 100 successively, ensuring that each number differs from the guesses of the 50 participants (at least 50 different numbers).

2005 = 0.\\]\nSince $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k$ are digits, their squares are at most $9^2 = 81$.\nTherefore, the first term $100d_1^2 + 20d_1d_2 + \\cdots + d_k^2$ is at most $100(9^2) = 8100$.\nSimilarly, the last term $40d_1 + 4d_2 + \\cdots + 4d_k$ is at most $40(9) = 360$.\nThe middle term $-10d_1d_2\\cdots d_k$ is at most $-10(9)(9) = -810$.\nAdding these inequalities, we get\n\\[8100 - 810 + 360 - 2005 = 6455.\\]\nTherefore, the sum of all $n$ that satisfy the given equation is at most $6455$.\nTo find the exact sum, we need to find all possible values of $n$ that satisfy the equation.\nWe can start by considering the possible values of $p(n)$.\nSince $p(n)$ is the product of the digits of $n$, it can range from $1$ to $9$.\nFor each possible value of $p(n)$, we can find the corresponding value of $n$ and check if it satisfies the equation.\nAfter checking all possible values of $p(n)$, we find that the only values of $n$ that satisfy the equation are $n = 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99$.\nThe sum of these values is $", "is_correct": "0"}

The mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3) of the binomial distribution are:\n\n\u03bc = n * p = 300 * 0.1056 = 31.68\n\u03c3 = sqrt(n * p * (1-p)) = sqrt(300 * 0.1056 * 0.8944) \u2248 5.47\n\nNow, we can standardize the value of 30 using the z-score formula:\n\nz = (30 - 31.68) / 5.47 \u2248 -0.305\n\nUsing the standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find the probability of a z-score less than -0.305:\n\nP(Z < -0.305) \u2248 0.3802\n\nSo, the probability that at most 30 of the selected bricks break under a force of 190 is approximately 0.3802.\n\n### Answer: 0.3802", "is_correct": "0"}

This probability can be found using the reflection principle:\n\n$\\mathbb{P}(\\text{Brownian motion starting at 0 hits 0 before time 3}) = \\mathbb{P}(T < 3)$\n\nTo find this probability, we can use the fact that the probability density function of the first hitting time of a Brownian motion is given by:\n\n$f(t) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t^3}}e^{-\\frac{t}{2}}$\n\nIntegrating this density function from 1 to 3, we get:\n\n$\\mathbb{P}(T < 3) = \\int_1^3 f(t) dt = \\int_1^3 \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t^3}}e^{-\\frac{t}{2}} dt$\n\nEvaluating this integral, we get:\n\n$\\mathbb{P}(T < 3) \\approx 0.43349$\n\nTherefore, the probability that $W_t = 0$ for some $t \\in [1, 3]$ is approximately 0.43349.\n\n### Answer: 0.43349", "is_correct": "0"}

We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$.

By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\tv+u=p,(2)\\\\\n\tvu=\\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\\:.$(4)\n\nFrom the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. \n\nSince (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition", "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct_response": " We can rewrite the given equation as $5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x - 66p = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{5(p+1)}{5} = p+1$.\nSince all three roots are natural numbers, $p+1$ must be a natural number.\nLet the three roots be $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, we have $a+b+c = p+1$ and $abc = \\frac{66p}{5}$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are natural numbers, $abc$ must be a multiple of 5.\nThe prime factorization of 66 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$.\nSince $abc$ is a multiple of 5, one of $a$, $b$, or $c$ must be a multiple of 5.\nWithout loss of generality, let $a$ be a multiple of 5.\nThen $abc = 5bc$, so $bc = \\frac{66p}{5}$.\nSince $bc$ is an integer, $p$ must be a multiple of 5.\nLet $p = 5k$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $abc = 66k$, so $a = \\frac{66k}{bc}$.\nSince $a$ is a natural number, $bc$ must divide 66.\nThe possible values of $bc$ are 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66.\nFor each value of $bc$, we can find the corresponding values of $a$ and $b$ (or $b$ and $c$) that satisfy $a+b+c = 5k+1$.\nThe possible values of $p$ are the values of $k$ that correspond to these values of $bc$.\nThe sum of all possible values of $p$ is $5+10+15+25+35+50+65+130 = \\boxed{335}$.\nThe answer is: 335", "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct_answer": "We can rewrite the given equation as $5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x - 66p = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{5(p+1)}{5} = p+1$.\nSince all three roots are natural numbers, $p+1$ must be a natural number.\nLet the three roots be $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, we have $a+b+c = p+1$ and $abc = \\frac{66p}{5}$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are natural numbers, $abc$ must be a multiple of 5.\nThe prime factorization of 66 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$.\nSince $abc$ is a multiple of 5, one of $a$, $b$, or $c$ must be a multiple of 5.\nWithout loss of generality, let $a$ be a multiple of 5.\nThen $abc = 5bc$, so $bc = \\frac{66p}{5}$.\nSince $bc$ is an integer, $p$ must be a multiple of 5.\nLet $p = 5k$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $abc = 66k$, so $a = \\frac{66k}{bc}$.\nSince $a$ is a natural number, $bc$ must divide 66.\nThe possible values of $bc$ are 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66.\nFor each value of $bc$, we can find the corresponding values of $a$ and $b$ (or $b$ and $c$) that satisfy $a+b+c = 5k+1$.\nThe possible values of $p$ are the values of $k$ that correspond to these values of $bc$.\nThe sum of all possible values of $p$ is $5+10+15+25+35+50+65+130 = \\boxed{335}$.\nThe answer is: 335", "true": "76 \\\\\n\\noindent", "pred": " We can rewrite the given equation as $5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x - 66p = 0$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is $\\frac{5(p+1)}{5} = p+1$.\nSince all three roots are natural numbers, $p+1$ must be a natural number.\nLet the three roots be $a$, $b$, and $c$.\nBy Vieta's formulas, we have $a+b+c = p+1$ and $abc = \\frac{66p}{5}$.\nSince $a$, $b$, and $c$ are natural numbers, $abc$ must be a multiple of 5.\nThe prime factorization of 66 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$.\nSince $abc$ is a multiple of 5, one of $a$, $b$, or $c$ must be a multiple of 5.\nWithout loss of generality, let $a$ be a multiple of 5.\nThen $abc = 5bc$, so $bc = \\frac{66p}{5}$.\nSince $bc$ is an integer, $p$ must be a multiple of 5.\nLet $p = 5k$ for some integer $k$.\nThen $abc = 66k$, so $a = \\frac{66k}{bc}$.\nSince $a$ is a natural number, $bc$ must divide 66.\nThe possible values of $bc$ are 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, 66.\nFor each value of $bc$, we can find the corresponding values of $a$ and $b$ (or $b$ and $c$) that satisfy $a+b+c = 5k+1$.\nThe possible values of $p$ are the values of $k$ that correspond to these values of $bc$.\nThe sum of all possible values of $p$ is $5+10+15+25+35+50+65+130 = \\boxed{335}$.\nThe answer is: 335", "is_correct": "0"}
