{"problem_id": "Problem_126", "question": "On a plane, there are 2019 points. Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

This means that for $m=0$, the set $K(n,m)$ is empty.\n### Step 3:  Now, we are asked to find the number of elements in $K(2004,2004)$. To do this, we need to understand how the set $K(n,m+1)$ is constructed from the sets $K(k,m)$ and $K(n-k,m)$.\n### Step 4:  For an element $k$ to be in $K(n,m+1)$, it must satisfy the condition that $K(k,m)\\cap K(n-k,m)=\\varnothing$. This implies that there are no common elements in the sets $K(k,m)$ and $K(n-k,m)$.\n### Step 5:  The problem provides a key insight that for any $k \\in K(n,m+1)$, $k \\le \\frac{n}{2}$. This means that the elements of $K(n,m+1)$ are restricted to the lower half of the range from $1$ to $n$.\n### Step 6:  Furthermore, the problem states that if $k \\in K(n,m+1)$, then $n-k \\in K(n,m+1)$.

Since $b > \\alpha$, we have $b = 2\\alpha - 1$. Furthermore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $b | \\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n$, $b | \\alpha_{n+1} - 2(n+1)\\alpha^{n+1}$, and $b | \\alpha_{n+2} - 2(n+2)\\alpha^{n+2}$. Combining these with $\\alpha_{n+2} = \\alpha_{n+1} + \\alpha_n$ and $b = 2\\alpha - 1$ being odd, we get\n\t\\[ b | (n+2)a^{n+2} - (n+1)a^{n+1} - na^n. \\]\n\tSince $(b, a) = 1$, we have $b | (n+2)a^2 - (n+1)a - n$.\n\t\\item By setting $n$ to $n+1$ in the above equation, we get $b | (n+3)a^2 - (n+2)a - (n+1)$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields $b | a^2 - a - 1$, i.e., $2a - 1 | a^2 - a - 1$. So, $2a - 1 | 2a^2 - 2a - 2$. Since $2\\alpha^2 \\equiv \\alpha \\pmod{2\\alpha - 1}$, we have $2\\alpha - 1 | -\\alpha - 2$ and $2\\alpha - 1 | -2\\alpha - 4$. Thus, $2\\alpha - 1 | -5$, implying $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ or $5$. However, $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ leads to $b = \\alpha$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $2\\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\t\\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n)$.

{"problem_id": "Problem_129", "question": "Given an integer $n > 2$. Now, there are $n$ people playing a game of \"Passing Numbers\". It is known that some people are friends (friendship is mutual), and each person has at least one friend. The rules of the game are as follows: each person first writes down a positive real number, and the $n$ positive real numbers written by everyone are all different; then, for each person, if he has $k$ friends, he divides the number he wrote by $k$, and tells all his friends the result obtained; finally, each person writes down the sum of all the numbers he hears. The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "2\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.\n\nLet the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$.\n\nConsider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n)$.\n\nUnder this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \\leq i \\leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time. From the conclusion, we know that at least one person writes down a smaller number the second time, thus, there must be another person who writes down a larger number the second time, so at least 2 people write down different numbers twice.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_response": "### Step 1:  The problem presents a game of \"Passing Numbers\" involving $n$ people, where each person writes down a unique positive real number and then shares a modified version of it with their friends.\n### Step 2:  To find the minimum number of times someone writes down different numbers, we need to consider the relationships between the people and how the numbers are shared.\n### Step 3:  Let's denote the person who writes down the number $x$ as $P_x$.

This gives $lh(4p)+4m(lw-4)+(w-l)h=0$. Since $lw-4=4p$, we have $lh(4p)+4m(4p)+(w-l)h=0$, and we can factor out a $4p$ to get $4p(lh+4m)+(w-l)h=0$. Since $lh+4m$ is an integer, we must have $4p(lh+4m)=0$ or $(w-l)h=0$. \n\nIf $4p(lh+4m)=0$, then $4p=0$, and we have $p=0$. However, this is a contradiction, since $p$ is a positive integer.

maximum value of $x+y+z$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n### Answer: 0", "true": "0\\\\\n\\noindent", "pred": "### Step 1:  We are given the equation $10x^{3}+20y^{3}+2006 xyz=2007z^{3}$ and asked to find the maximum value of $x+y+z$.\n### Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can first try to simplify the given equation by dividing it by $2$ to obtain $5x^{3}+10y^{3}+1003xyz=1003.5z^{3}$.\n### Step 3:  Rearranging the terms, we get $5x^{3}+10y^{3}+1003xyz=1003.5z^{3} \\Rightarrow 5x^{3}+10y^{3}+1003xyz-1003.5z^{3}=0$.\n### Step 4:  We can then factor out $5$ from the first two terms to get $5(x^{3}+2y^{3})+1003xyz-1003.5z^{3}=0$.\n### Step 5:  Dividing by $5$ gives us $x^{3}+2y^{3}+200.7xyz-201.4z^{3}=0$.\n### Step 6:  Since $x, y, z$ are integers, we can deduce that $x^{3}+2y^{3}$ is an integer, and $200.7xyz-201.4z^{3}$ must be an integer as well.\n### Step 7:  From this, we can conclude that $200.7xyz-201.4z^{3}$ must be a multiple of $0.7$ and $-0.4$ respectively.\n### Step 8:  Multiplying both sides by $10$ gives us $2007xyz-2014z^{3}=0$.\n### Step 9:  This can be rearranged to give $2007xyz=2014z^{3}$, which further simplifies to $xyz=\\frac{2014}{2007}z^{3}$.\n### Step 10:  Since $z$ is an integer, we can deduce that $xyz$ is a multiple of $z$.\n### Step 11:  This implies that $2014$ must be a multiple of $2007$, which is not possible.\n### Step 12:  Therefore, we have a contradiction, and the only possible solution is when $z=0$.\n### Step 13:  Substituting $z=0$ back into the original equation, we get $10x^{3}+20y^{3}=0$.\n### Step 14:  This simplifies to $2x^{3}+4y^{3}=0$, and further to $x^{3}+2y^{3}=0$.\n### Step 15:  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, we can deduce that $x$ and $y$ must be multiples of $0$.\n### Step 16:  However, this is impossible,

$x+y+z=0+0+0=0$, which is the maximum value of $x+y+z$.\n### Step 19:  Therefore, the maximum value of $x+y+z$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\n### Answer: 0", "is_correct": "1"}

Let's denote the other factor as $p(x)$. Since the degree of $x^{13}+x+90$ is $13$, the degree of $p(x)$ is $11$. Since $x^2-x+a$ has real coefficients, $p(x)$ also has real coefficients. \n\nIf $p(x)$ has real coefficients, then it can be written in the form $p(x)=b_{11}x^{11}+\\cdots+b_1x+b_0$, where $b_{11},\\ldots,b_1,b_0\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Since the leading coefficient of $p(x)$ is $b_{11}$, we have $b_{11}\\neq 0$. Thus, $p(x)$ has a nonzero leading coefficient, which implies that $p(x)$ is not a constant polynomial. \n\nSince $p(x)$ is not a constant polynomial, $p(x)$ has at least one root. Let $r$ be a root of $p(x)$. Then $p(x)$ can be written as $p(x)=(x-r)q(x)$, where $q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $10$.

Since $r$ is a root of $p(x)$, we have $p(r)=0$. \n\nSince $p(x)$ has real coefficients, the complex roots of $p(x)$ come in conjugate pairs. Since $p(x)$ has degree $11$, the complex roots of $p(x)$ come in at most $5$ conjugate pairs. Since $r$ is a real root of $p(x)$, the complex roots of $p(x)$ come in at most $5$ conjugate pairs.

Since the complex roots of $p(x)$ come in at most $5$ conjugate pairs, the complex roots of $p(x)$ come in at most $5$ conjugate pairs. Thus, the complex roots of $p(x)$ come in at most $5$ conjugate pairs.\n\nSince the complex roots of $p(x)$ come in at most $5$ conjugate pairs, we have at most $10$ complex roots of $p(x)$. Since the degree of $p(x)$ is $11$, we have at most $10$ complex roots of $p(x)$. Thus, $p(x)$ has at most $10$ complex roots.\n\nSince $p(x)$ has at most $10$ complex roots, we have at most $10$ complex roots of $p(x)$.

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$. Consequently, the total number of functions $f$ with a fixed point is calculated as $\\sum\\limits_{c=1}^n(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2=C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.\nAs a result, the number of functions $f$ without a fixed point is found as $C_{2n-1}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-1}=C_{2n-2}^{n-2}$.

We can use a standard normal distribution table to find the probability that $W_3 = 0$:\n\n$$P(W_3 = 0) = P(Z = 0) = \\Phi(0) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nwhere $\\Phi(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\n\nTherefore, the probability that $W_t = 0$ for some $t \\in [1, 3]$ is:\n\n$$P(\\exists t \\in [1, 3] \\text{ s.t. } W_t = 0) = 2P(W_3 = 0) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$$\n\n### Answer: 1", "is_correct": "0"}

This can be done in $\\binom{16}{3}$ ways, but we must subtract the cases where the three points are adjacent to each other, which is 16.\n\nIn total, there are $17\\cdot2 + 17\\cdot16 + \\binom{16}{3} - 16$ ways to choose three points that form a right-angled triangle or an obtuse-angled triangle.\n\nSince there are $\\binom{17}{3}=680$ ways to choose three points from the vertices of the polygon, the number of ways to choose three points that form an acute-angled triangle is $680 - (17\\cdot2 + 17\\cdot16 + \\binom{16}{3} - 16) = 680 - 544 - 80 + 16 = 72$.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the chosen points form an acute-angled triangle is $\\frac{72}{680}=\\frac{9}{85}$.\n\n### Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{85}}$", "is_correct": "0"}

According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.\n\nLemma: For any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n-k} \\leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:\n\n$A-T \\leq 2^{n}-n-1$\n\n$\\Rightarrow T \\geq n$\n\nEquality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nNext, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\\left\\{0,1, \\cdots, 2^{n}-1\\right\\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \\in\\{1,2 n-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, there are two paths: $\\{0,2,1,3\\}$ and $\\{0,2,3,1\\}$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.\n\n(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\\left\\{0,2,4, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\\right\\}$.\n(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\\left\\{1,3,5, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\\right\\}$.\n(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.\n\nTherefore, we can use the path $0 \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-2\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right) \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nIn this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_response": "### Step 1:  The problem describes a scenario where a frog starts at the origin of a number line and makes $2^n -

By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\tv+u=p,(2)\\\\\n\tvu=\\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\\:.$(4)\n\nFrom the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number.
