{"problem_id": "Problem_126", "question": "On a plane, there are 2019 points. Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

So, the total number of five-digit numbers with exactly three different digits is C(6,3) * P(5,3) * 3^2.\n\n2. Four different digits: We can choose 4 digits from the 6 available in C(6,4) ways. Then, we can arrange these 4 digits in 5 positions in P(5,4) ways. The remaining one position can be filled with any of the remaining 2 digits, which can be done in 2 ways. So, the total number of five-digit numbers with exactly four different digits is C(6,4) * P(5,4) * 2.\n\n3. Five different digits: We can choose all 5 digits from the 6 available in C(6,5) ways. Then, we can arrange these 5 digits in 5 positions in P(5,5) ways. So, the total number of five-digit numbers with exactly five different digits is C(6,5) * P(5,5).\n\nNow, we need to subtract the numbers that have 1 and 6 adjacent. We can treat 1 and 6 as a single unit, which gives us 5 units (16, 2, 3, 4, 5). We can arrange these 5 units in 5 positions in P(5,5) ways. The remaining four positions can be filled with any of the remaining 4 digits, which can be done in 4^4 ways. So, the total number of five-digit numbers with 1 and 6 adjacent is P(5,5) * 4^4.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of five-digit numbers satisfying the given conditions is:\n\nTotal - (Three different digits) - (Four different digits) - (Five different digits) + (1 and 6 adjacent)\n\n= 7776 - (C(6,3) * P(5,3) * 3^2) - (C(6,4) * P(5,4) * 2) - (C(6,5) * P(5,5)) + (P(5,5) * 4^4)\n\n= 7776 - (20 * 60 * 9) - (15 * 20 * 2) - (6 * 120) + (120 * 256)\n\n= 7776 - 10800 - 300 - 720 + 30720\n\n= 7776 - 14520 + 30720\n\n= 24076\n\nSo, there are 24076 five-digit numbers satisfying the given conditions.\n\n### Answer: 24076.", "is_correct": "0"}

Since $b > \\alpha$, we have $b = 2\\alpha - 1$. Furthermore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $b | \\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n$, $b | \\alpha_{n+1} - 2(n+1)\\alpha^{n+1}$, and $b | \\alpha_{n+2} - 2(n+2)\\alpha^{n+2}$. Combining these with $\\alpha_{n+2} = \\alpha_{n+1} + \\alpha_n$ and $b = 2\\alpha - 1$ being odd, we get\n\t\\[ b | (n+2)a^{n+2} - (n+1)a^{n+1} - na^n. \\]\n\tSince $(b, a) = 1$, we have $b | (n+2)a^2 - (n+1)a - n$.\n\t\\item By setting $n$ to $n+1$ in the above equation, we get $b | (n+3)a^2 - (n+2)a - (n+1)$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields $b | a^2 - a - 1$, i.e., $2a - 1 | a^2 - a - 1$. So, $2a - 1 | 2a^2 - 2a - 2$. Since $2\\alpha^2 \\equiv \\alpha \\pmod{2\\alpha - 1}$, we have $2\\alpha - 1 | -\\alpha - 2$ and $2\\alpha - 1 | -2\\alpha - 4$. Thus, $2\\alpha - 1 | -5$, implying $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ or $5$. However, $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ leads to $b = \\alpha$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $2\\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\t\\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n)$.

Since the numbers written by the friends of person $i$ are all different, the number written by person $i$ must be different from the numbers written by their friends. Therefore, person $i$ will write down a different number.\n\nSince this argument holds for any person with more than one friend, we can conclude that in the case when some people have more than one friend, the sum of all $d_i$ values will be less than $n$.\n\nThus, the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers is $n$.", "is_correct": "0"}

We want to find the minimum possible value of $n$.\n\nFirst, let's expand the right side of the equation:\n\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_{i}x + b_{i})^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_{i}^2x^2 + 2a_{i}b_{i}x + b_{i}^2)$.\n\nNow, we can group the terms with the same powers of $x$:\n\n$(a_{1}^2 + a_{2}^2 + \\cdots + a_{n}^2)x^2 + 2(a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}b_{2} + \\cdots + a_{n}b_{n})x + b_{1}^2 + b_{2}^2 + \\cdots + b_{n}^2$.\n\nSince this expression must be equal to $x^2 + x + 4$ for any real number $x$, we can equate the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $x$:\n\n1. $a_{1}^2 + a_{2}^2 + \\cdots + a_{n}^2 = 1$\n2. $2(a_{1}b_{1} + a_{2}b_{2} + \\cdots + a_{n}b_{n}) = 1$\n3. $b_{1}^2 + b_{2}^2 + \\cdots + b_{n}^2 = 4$\n\nNow, we want to find the minimum possible value of $n$. Notice that the first equation implies that the sum of the squares of the $a_i$'s is equal to 1. Since the $a_i$'s are rational numbers, the only way this can happen is if there are at least two distinct $a_i$'s, say $a_1$ and $a_2$, such that $a_1^2 + a_2^2 = 1$. This is because if all $a_i$'s were equal, then their sum of squares would be greater than 1.\n\nSimilarly, the third equation implies that the sum of the squares of the $b_i$'s is equal to 4.

Then, by the mean value property, we have:\n\n$$u(x_0) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_n r^{n-1}} \\int_{\\partial B(x_0, r)} u(x) \\, dS(x)$$\n\nSince $u$ is harmonic, we can apply the mean value property to the function $100(100+\\ln(100+|x|^{100}))$ as well:\n\n$$100(100+\\ln(100+|x_0|^{100})) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_n r^{n-1}} \\int_{\\partial B(x_0, r)} 100(100+\\ln(100+|x|^{100})) \\, dS(x)$$\n\nNow, we can bound the integral on the right-hand side:\n\n$$\\int_{\\partial B(x_0, r)} 100(100+\\ln(100+|x|^{100})) \\, dS(x) \\leq 100(100+\\ln(100+|x_0|^{100})) \\cdot \\omega_n r^{n-1}$$\n\nCombining the two equations, we get:\n\n$$u(x_0) \\leq \\frac{100(100+\\ln(100+|x_0|^{100})) \\cdot \\omega_n r^{n-1}}{\\omega_n r^{n-1}} = 100(100+\\ln(100+|x_0|^{100}))$$\n\nHowever, this contradicts the given inequality for $u$:\n\n$$|u(x_0)| \\leq 100(100+\\ln(100+|x_0|^{100}))$$\n\nSince we have reached a contradiction, our assumption that $u$ is not constant must be false. Therefore, $u$ is a constant function.\n\nSo, the final answer is: [u is a constant].", "is_correct": "1"}

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$.

Anna can choose one of these numbers in each round, ensuring that $S_n$ is not divisible by $p$.\n\nCarl's strategy:\nCarl can choose a number $b$ such that $ab$ is divisible by $p$.

In this case, we can have 0, 2, 4,..., 94 - 2 = 92 - 2 = 90 - 2 = 88 - 2 = 86 - 2 = 84 - 2 = 82 - 2 = 80 - 2 = 78 - 2 = 76 - 2 = 74 - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 - 2 = 68 - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62 - 2 = 60 - 2 = 58 - 2 = 56 - 2 = 54 - 2 = 52 - 2 = 50 - 2 = 48 - 2 = 46 - 2 = 44 - 2 = 42 - 2 = 40 - 2 = 38 - 2 = 36 - 2 = 34 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28 - 2 = 26 - 2 = 24 - 2 = 22 - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14 - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0 - 2 = 0, 2, 4,..., 94.\n\nFor each of these even numbers of -1's, the sum of pairwise products will be positive. The minimum possible value of the positive sum occurs when we have the smallest even number of -1's, which is 0. In this case, all 95 numbers are +1, and the sum of pairwise products is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 95} a_i a_j = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 95} 1 \\cdot 1 = \\binom{95}{2} = \\frac{95 \\cdot 94}{2} = 4455\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of the positive sum is 4455.", "is_correct": "0"}

Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$.
