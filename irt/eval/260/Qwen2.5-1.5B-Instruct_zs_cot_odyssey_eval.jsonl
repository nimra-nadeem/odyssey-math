Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

These numbers fall into two categories: those with only one or two different digits, and those with all six digits but where 1 and 6 are adjacent.\n\n**Case 1: Numbers with only one or two different digits**\n\n- **Numbers with exactly one digit:** There are \\(6\\) such numbers (one for each digit from 1 to 6).\n- **Numbers with exactly two digits:** We choose 2 out of 6 digits in \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) ways. For each pair of digits, there are \\(2! = 2\\) permutations. However, since these pairs must alternate between the two digits, there are no valid arrangements here because the only possible arrangement would be repeating one of the digits, which violates the requirement of having at least three different digits. So, there are \\(0\\) such numbers.\n  \nThus, the number of five-digit numbers with only one or two different digits is \\(6 + 0 = 6\\).\n\n**Case 2: Numbers where 1 and 6 are adjacent**\n\nWe treat \"16\" as a single block, so we are now arranging 4 blocks (the block \"16\", and the other 3 digits). The number of ways to arrange these 4 blocks is \\(4!\\) (since each digit can appear in any position among the four positions), and within the block \"16\", the order does not matter. Therefore, the number of such arrangements is:\n\\[4! \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48.\\]\nHowever, we also need to consider the cases where 1 and 6 are not adjacent but they are part of the same group of 2 consecutive digits. We will use complementary counting here. First, we find the total number of arrangements of the digits 1 through 6 without restriction, which is \\(6^5 = 7776\\). From Case 1, we already know there are 6 such numbers (numbers with exactly one or two different digits). So, the number of arrangements where 1 and 6 are adjacent but part of the same group of 2 consecutive digits is \\(7776 - 6 = 7770\\). But we need to exclude the case where both 1 and 6 are used, which was counted twice. Thus, the correct count is:\n\\[7770 - 6 = 7764.\\]\n\nSo, the number of five-digit numbers with at least three different digits and where 1 and 6 are not adjacent is:\n\\[7776 - 6 - 7764 = 96.\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of five-digit numbers satisfying the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{96}.\n\\]", "is_correct": "0"}

{"problem_id": "Problem_129", "question": "Given an integer $n > 2$. Now, there are $n$ people playing a game of \"Passing Numbers\". It is known that some people are friends (friendship is mutual), and each person has at least one friend. The rules of the game are as follows: each person first writes down a positive real number, and the $n$ positive real numbers written by everyone are all different; then, for each person, if he has $k$ friends, he divides the number he wrote by $k$, and tells all his friends the result obtained; finally, each person writes down the sum of all the numbers he hears. The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "2\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.\n\nLet the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$.\n\nConsider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n)$.\n\nUnder this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \\leq i \\leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time.

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$. Consequently, the total number of functions $f$ with a fixed point is calculated as $\\sum\\limits_{c=1}^n(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2=C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.\nAs a result, the number of functions $f$ without a fixed point is found as $C_{2n-1}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-1}=C_{2n-2}^{n-2}$.

This suggests an error or misinterpretation; instead, we need to recheck the options provided.\n\nLet's re-evaluate using the correct approach:\n\nGiven: \\(64b^2 - 16b + 1\\)\n\nWe look at the coefficients:\n- \\(a^2 = 64b^2\\) implies \\(a = 8b\\)\n- \\(b^2 = 1\\) implies \\(b = 1\\)\n\nThe middle term should be \\(2ab = 2(8b)(1) = 16b\\).\n\nSince there seems to be a discrepancy between the given problem statement and the provided options, I will assume you intended to use the correct method and provide the correct factorization based on the options given.\n\n### Correct Approach:\nConsider the difference of squares identity:\n\n\\[a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\\]\n\nRewriting the given expression:\n\n\\[64b^2 - 16b + 1 = (8b)^2 - (4b)^2 + 1\\]\n\nThis resembles the difference of squares pattern but doesn't directly fit into the standard form without further manipulation.\n\n### Revisiting the Options:\nGiven the options, none seem to perfectly match the derived factorization directly. However, since the problem asks us to choose from the provided options, we must infer which one best approximates the solution based on common algebraic identities and their applications.\n\n### Conclusion:\nNone of the provided options exactly match the direct factorization of \\(64b^2 - 16b + 1\\). Therefore, there might have been a misunderstanding in the problem setup or interpretation. If you meant to factor something else or had a different context, please clarify, and I'll adjust my response accordingly.\n\n### Final Answer:\nBased on the available information and typical algebraic manipulations, no option fully captures the exact factorization of \\(64b^2 - 16b + 1\\). If the intent was to factor differently or solve another problem, please provide more details or specify the correct target expression.", "is_correct": "0"}

This process will give us even more numbers.\n- For five-digit numbers or higher, the same principle applies.\n\nThe key point here is that every \"auspicious number\" can be expressed uniquely as a combination of digits that sum to 7.

According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.\n\nLemma: For any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n-k} \\leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:\n\n$A-T \\leq 2^{n}-n-1$\n\n$\\Rightarrow T \\geq n$\n\nEquality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nNext, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\\left\\{0,1, \\cdots, 2^{n}-1\\right\\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \\in\\{1,2 n-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, there are two paths: $\\{0,2,1,3\\}$ and $\\{0,2,3,1\\}$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.\n\n(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\\left\\{0,2,4, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\\right\\}$.\n(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\\left\\{1,3,5, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\\right\\}$.\n(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.\n\nTherefore, we can use the path $0 \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-2\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right) \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nIn this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct_response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the frog's jumps affect its position on the number line and calculate the reciprocal sum of the step lengths for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nFirstly, let's consider the positions that the frog visits after making \\( 2^n - 1 \\) jumps.

This yields:\n\n$$\n\\left[(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000}\n$$\n\nFrom this equation, we deduce that:\n\n$$(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1=1000 \\times \\frac{\\overline{a b 2}}{\\overline{a 2 d}}$$\n\nBecause \\(0.5<\\frac{\\overline{a b 2}}{\\overline{a 2 d}}<2\\), we conclude that \\(500<(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1<2000\\). Hence, \\(a\\) can be \\(2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\). However, since \\(\\overline{a 2 d}\\) cannot be 125 or 625, it can provide at most 2 factors of 5. Therefore, \\((\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\) must be a multiple of 5, leading to the possible values \\(b=1, 9, 4,\\) or \\(6\\).\n\nBased on the equation \\(\\left[(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000}\\), we have:\n\n(1) \\((\\overline{a b}+1) \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000} \\div(\\overline{a b}-1)>1000\\)\n\n(2) \\((\\overline{a b}-1) \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000} \\div(\\overline{a b}+1)<1000\\)\n\nConsequently, \\(a\\) can only be 3. Then, \\((\\overline{a b}-1) \\times(\\overline{a b}+1)\\) cannot be a multiple of 25, implying that \\(\\overline{a 2 d}\\) must be a multiple of 25. Thus, \\(d=5\\), and \\(\\overline{a 2 d}=325\\).\n\nNow, \\((\\overline{3 b}-1) \\times(\\overline{3 b}+1) \\times 325=\\overline{3 b 2000}\\), where \\(\\overline{3 b 2000}\\) is a multiple of 16. This means that either \\((\\overline{3 b}-1)\\) or \\((\\overline{3 b}+1)\\) must be a multiple of 8. Therefore, \\(b\\) can be 1 or 3.

By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\tv+u=p,(2)\\\\\n\tvu=\\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\\:.$(4)\n\nFrom the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number.
