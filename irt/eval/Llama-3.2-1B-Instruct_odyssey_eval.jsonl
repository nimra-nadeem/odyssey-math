Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

Since we are given that $x_0>0$, we must have $x_0=\\frac{2}{3}", "true": "$\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ \\\\\n\\noindent", "pred": "### Answer: $x_0=1$\n\nWe have that $\\overrightarrow{PQ}=t\\overrightarrow{QA}=(2-t)\\overrightarrow{QB}$, so $t\\overrightarrow{QA}=(2-t)\\overrightarrow{QB}$. Since $\\overrightarrow{QA}=(x_0,0)$ and $\\overrightarrow{QB}=(x_0, y_0)$, we have $t(x_0,0)=(2-t)(x_0,y_0)$. This gives us the system of equations $tx_0=2t-x_0$ and $y_0=2y_0-t$. Solving the first equation for $t$, we get $t=\\frac{2-x_0}{x_0}$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $y_0=2y_0-\\frac{2-x_0}{x_0}$. Rearranging this equation, we get $\\frac{2-x_0}{x_0}=\\frac{y_0-2}{y_0}$. Cross-multiplying, we get $(2-x_0)y_0=y_0-2$. Subtracting $y_0$ from both sides, we get $(2-x_0)y_0-y_0=2-x_0$. Factoring out $y_0$, we get $y_0(2-x_0-y)=2-x_0$. Dividing both sides by $(2-x_0-y)$, we get $\\frac{y_0}{2-x_0-y}=\\frac{2-x_0}{2-x_0-y}$. Since the denominators are not equal, we know that $\\frac{y_0}{2-x_0-y}$ is not defined. However, we also know that $\\frac{y_0}{2-x_0-y}$ is equal to $\\frac{y_0-2}{y_0}$. Therefore, we can set $\\frac{y_0-2}{y_0}=\\frac{y_0}{2-x_0-y}$. Cross-multiplying, we get $(y_0-2)(2-x_0-y)=y_0(2-x_0-y)$. Expanding both sides, we get $2y_0-2x_0-2y_0-y^2=2y_0-2x_0-y^2$. Subtracting $2y_0-2x_0$ from both sides, we get $-y^2-y=0$. Factoring out $-y$, we get $-(y+1)(y-1)=0$. Therefore, we have two possible solutions: $y=-1$ or $y=1$. Substituting these values into the equation $\\frac{y_0}{2-x_0-y}=\\frac{2-x_0}{2-x_0-y}$, we can solve for $x_0$. If $y_0=-1$, then $\\frac{x_0}{2-x_0-1}=\\frac{2-x_0}{2-x_0-1}$. Cross-multiplying, we get $(2-x_0)(x_0+1)=(2-x_0)(2-x_0)$. Expanding both sides, we get $2x_0+x_0+2=4-2x_0+2x_0$. Simplifying both sides, we get $3x_0+2=4$. Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we get $3x_0=2$. Dividing both sides by $3$, we get $x_0=\\frac{2}{3}$. If $y_0=1$, then $\\frac{x_0}{2-x_0-1}=\\frac{2-x_0}{2-x_0-1}$.

Subtracting $2$ from both sides, we get $3x_0=2$. Dividing both sides by $3$, we get $x_0=\\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, we have two possible solutions: $x_0=\\frac{2}{3}$ or $x_0=\\frac{2}{3}$.

The numbers that do not satisfy the condition are those in which 1 and 6 are adjacent. We can treat 1 and 6 as a single unit, so there are 5 choices for the first digit (since it cannot be 0), 4 choices for the second, 3 for the third, 2 for the fourth, and 1 for the fifth. Therefore, there are $5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 120$ numbers that do not satisfy the condition. \n\nTherefore, the number of five-digit numbers satisfying the given condition is $720 - 120 = \\boxed{600}$.", "is_correct": "0"}
