Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points. Thus, the proposition is proved.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct_response": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how circles can divide the plane and ensure that no closed shape contains more than one point.\n\nFirstly, consider a single circle. A single circle divides the plane into two regions (inside and outside), but it does not separate points effectively unless the points lie on the circumference or are symmetrically placed in such a way that they do not end up in the same region.\n\nNow, consider two circles. Two circles can intersect at most at two points. If we draw two circles such that each point lies in a different region created by these circles, we can achieve separation. However, with just two circles, it might not be possible to separate all 2019 points if they are not optimally placed.\n\nTo generalize, let's use the concept from combinatorial geometry. For \\( n \\) points, we need enough circles to create enough regions to ensure each point is in a distinct region. Each new circle intersects all previous circles and can create additional regions.\n\nThe key insight is that with \\( k \\) circles, the maximum number of regions \\( R(k) \\) created is given by:\n\\[ R(k) = k^2 - k + 2 \\]\n\nWe need \\( R(k) \\geq 2019 \\).

Now we establish the recursive formula for $S_n$. We divide $S_n$ into three categories: \n\nLet $a_{n}$ denote the number of nn-digit numbers with the first digit being 1, $b_{n}$ denote the number of nn-digit numbers with the first digit being 2, 3, 4, or 5, and $c_{n}$ \n\nIt's evident that $S_{n}=a_{n}+b_{n}+c_{n}$, and\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\na_{n}=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}, \\\\\nb_{n}=4\\left(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}\\right), \\\\\nc_{n}=b_{n-1}+c_{n-1} .\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThen $S_{n}=5\\left(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}\\right)+b_{n-1}$\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n=5 S_{n-1}+4 S_{n-2}(n \\geqslant 3) . \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nFrom $S_{1}=6$ and $S_{2}=34$ and we get \n$S_{3}=194, S_{4}=1106, S_{5}=6306 $.\n\nSubtracting the cases where there is exactly one digit or exactly two digits, and 1 and 6 are not adjacent, from $S_{5}$, there are  $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{6}^{2}-1\\right)\\left(2^{5}-2\\right)=420$. \n\nTherefore, the number of five-digit numbers satisfying the condition is  6306-6-420=5880.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct_response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of five-digit numbers formed by the digits 1 through 6 that satisfy two conditions: they must have at least three different digits, and the digits 1 and 6 must not be adjacent.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of five-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 1 through 6 without any restrictions. This is simply \\(6^5 = 7776\\).\n\nNext, we need to subtract the cases where there are fewer than three different digits. There are two scenarios to consider here:\n1. The number uses exactly one digit (e.g., 11111).\n2. The number uses exactly two digits (e.g., 11112, 11122, etc.).\n\nFor the first scenario, there are 6 such numbers (one for each digit from 1 to 6).\n\nFor the second scenario, we need to choose 2 out of the 6 digits, which can be done in \\(\\binom{6}{2} = 15\\) ways. For each pair of digits, the number of five-digit sequences that can be formed is the sum of the sequences where one digit appears 0 times, 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, 4 times, or 5 times, but excluding the case where only one digit appears (already counted above). This is given by \\(2^5 - 2 = 30\\) (since each position can be either of the two digits, minus the two cases where all positions are the same digit). Therefore, the number of five-digit sequences using exactly two digits is \\(15 \\times 30 = 450\\).\n\nSo, the number of five-digit sequences that use at most two different digits is \\(6 + 450 = 456\\). Thus, the number of five-digit sequences that use at least three different digits is \\(7776 - 456 = 7320\\).\n\nNow, we need to subtract the cases where 1 and 6 are adjacent. We treat \"16\" and \"61\" as single units. If we treat \"16\" as a single unit, we are forming a four-unit sequence from the units {16, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and similarly for \"61\". The number of such sequences is \\(5 \\times 5! = 5 \\times 120 = 600\\) for each case (since we choose 4 out of the remaining 5 digits and arrange them, plus the \"16\" or \"61\"). However, we need to ensure that these sequences use at least three different digits. The only way to form a sequence with fewer than three different digits using \"16\" or \"61\" is if the other digits are repeated, but since we are forming a five-digit number, this is not possible (it would require at least one digit to appear three times, which is not feasible with only one \"16\" or \"61\" and the rest being the same digit). So, all 600 sequences for each case use at least three different digits. Therefore, the total number of sequences where 1 and 6 are adjacent and use at least three different digits is \\(600 + 600 = 1200\\).\n\nFinally, the number of five-digit sequences that use at least three different digits and do not have 1 and 6 adjacent is \\(7320 - 1200 = 6120\\).\n\n### Answer: 6120", "Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct_answer": "6120"}
