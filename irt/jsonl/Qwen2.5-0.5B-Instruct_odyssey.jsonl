{"problem_id": "Problem_126", "question": "On a plane, there are 2019 points. Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

When we distribute the cards as follows:\n\n- Person 1 gets cards labeled 1 through 14.\n- Person 2 gets cards labeled 15 through 28.\n- Person 3 gets cards labeled 29 through 42.\n- And so on, up to Person 14 getting cards labeled 63 through 77.\n\nThis distribution ensures that no two people receive the same set of three consecutive numbers. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]", "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number of cards \\( n \\) such that when these cards are distributed among 17 people, there is always one person who receives cards with numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), where \\( x > y \\), and \\( 118x \\leqslant 119y \\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the condition \\( 118x \\leqslant 119y \\). This inequality can be rewritten as:\n\\[ x \\geqslant \\frac{119}{118} y. \\]\nSince \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, the smallest possible value for \\( x \\) occurs when \\( y = 1 \\), giving us:\n\\[ x \\geqslant \\frac{119}{118}. \\]\nCalculating the value of \\( \\frac{119}{118} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{119}{118} \\approx 1.0356. \\]\nSo, the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1.0356 is 2. Therefore, \\( x \\geqslant 2 \\).\n\nNow, consider distributing the cards such that no two people receive the same set of three consecutive numbers. We will start by trying to fit as many cards as possible into 17 people.\n\nIf we have 17 cards, then the maximum number of different sets of three consecutive numbers is 17 - 1 + 1 = 17. However, if we distribute them in such a way that no two people receive the same set of three consecutive numbers, we would need more than 17 cards. Instead, we should try to use fewer cards while still satisfying the condition.\n\nLet's try to use 16 cards first. If we have 16 cards, then the maximum number of different sets of three consecutive numbers is 16 - 1 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is less than 17, it is not enough to satisfy the condition. So, we need to increase the number of cards.\n\nNext, let's try using 17 cards. If we have 17 cards, then the maximum number of different sets of three consecutive numbers is 16 - 1 + 1 = 16. Again, since 16 is less than 17, it is not enough to satisfy the condition. So, we need to decrease the number of cards.\n\nFinally, let's try using 15 cards. If we have 15 cards, then the maximum number of different sets of three consecutive numbers is 14 - 1 + 1 = 14. Since 14 is less than 15, it is not enough to satisfy the condition either. So, we need to increase the number of cards.\n\nWe can continue this process until we find the smallest \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition. After some trial and error, we find that using 14 cards works. When we distribute the cards as follows:\n\n- Person 1 gets cards labeled 1 through 14.\n- Person 2 gets cards labeled 15 through 28.\n- Person 3 gets cards labeled 29 through 42.\n- And so on, up to Person 14 getting cards labeled 63 through 77.\n\nThis distribution ensures that no two people receive the same set of three consecutive numbers. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) that satisfies the condition is:\n\\[ \\boxed{14} \\]"}
