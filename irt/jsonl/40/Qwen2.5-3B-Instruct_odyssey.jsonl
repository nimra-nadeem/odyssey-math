Now we establish the recursive formula for $S_n$.

Each digit can be chosen independently from 6 options, so there are:\n\\[ 6^5 = 7776 \\]\nfive-digit numbers.\n\nNext, we need to subtract the number of five-digit numbers that have fewer than three different digits.

We now treat this block as a single entity along with the other 3 digits, making it 4 entities to arrange (the block and the other 3 digits).\n\n- **Arranging the blocks:**\n  The block \"16\" or \"61\" can be placed in 4! ways (since we treat the block as one unit and arrange it with the other 3 digits):\n  \\[ 4! = 24 \\]\n\n- **Digits within the block:**\n  Within the block, 1 and 6 can switch places, giving us 2 permutations for the block.\n\n- **Digits outside the block:**\n  The remaining 3 digits (2, 3, 4, 5) can be arranged in 3! ways:\n  \\[ 3! = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the number of arrangements where 1 and 6 are adjacent is:\n\\[ 24 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 288 \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Subtract the invalid cases from the valid cases.\nThe number of five-digit numbers with at least three different digits and 1 and 6 not adjacent is:\n\\[ 7320 - 288 = 7032 \\]\n\n### Final Answer:\n### Answer: 7032", "Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct_answer": "###"}
