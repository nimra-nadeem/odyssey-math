Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points.

Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough.

We can continue this pattern, but we need to find the maximum number of points that can be contained within a closed shape without violating the $k$-good condition.\n\nLet's consider the case of a pentagon, which can contain at most 5 points.

Combining these with $\\alpha_{n+2} = \\alpha_{n+1} + \\alpha_n$ and $b = 2\\alpha - 1$ being odd, we get\n\t\\[ b | (n+2)a^{n+2} - (n+1)a^{n+1} - na^n. \\]\n\tSince $(b, a) = 1$, we have $b | (n+2)a^2 - (n+1)a - n$.\n\t\\item By setting $n$ to $n+1$ in the above equation, we get $b | (n+3)a^2 - (n+2)a - (n+1)$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields $b | a^2 - a - 1$, i.e., $2a - 1 | a^2 - a - 1$. So, $2a - 1 | 2a^2 - 2a - 2$.

Hence, $2\\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\t\\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n)$.

If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time. From the conclusion, we know that at least one person writes down a smaller number the second time, thus, there must be another person who writes down a larger number the second time, so at least 2 people write down different numbers twice.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct_response": " Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1.

We are looking for P(X \u2264 30).\n- To use the standard normal distribution, we need to standardize the variable using the z-score formula: z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n- For X = 30, z = (30 - 150) / 8.66 \u2248 -13.85\n\nStep 4: Find the probability using the standard normal distribution table or a calculator.\n- Since the z-score is very far into the left tail of the standard normal distribution, the probability is extremely close to 0.\n\n\\noindent Answer: The probability that at most 30 of the selected bricks break under a force of 190 is approximately 0.\n\nNote: The assumption of p = 0.5 may not be accurate, and the actual probability could be different. To obtain a more accurate estimate, additional information about the probability of breaking under a force of 190 is needed."}

The lower critical value (\u03c7^2_L) is approximately 0.484, and the upper critical value (\u03c7^2_U) is approximately 18.467.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the confidence interval for the population variance\nLower limit = (df * s^2) / \u03c7^2_U\nLower limit = (4 * 144.5) / 18.467\nLower limit \u2248 32.07\n\nUpper limit = (df * s^2) / \u03c7^2_L\nUpper limit = (4 * 144.5) / 0.484\nUpper limit \u2248 1171.43\n\nSo, the 99% confidence interval for the population variance of the ages of all professors at the university is approximately (32.07, 1171.43).\n\n### Answer: (32.07, 1171.43)"}

Therefore, the slope of the tangent line is $\\frac{b}{a}$.\n\nNow, let's find the equation of the tangent line to the hyperbola $\\Gamma$. The general equation of a tangent to a hyperbola $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ is given by $\\frac{x}{a} \\cdot x - \\frac{y}{b} \\cdot y = 1$. Comparing this with the given hyperbola, we have $a^2 = 7$ and $b^2 = 5$. So, the equation of the tangent line is $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{7}} \\cdot x - \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot y = 1$.\n\nSince the slope of the tangent line is $\\frac{b}{a}$, we can write the equation of the tangent line as:\n\n$\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{7}} \\cdot \\frac{b}{a}$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{5} \\cdot \\sqrt{7} \\cdot a$, we get:\n\n$y \\cdot \\sqrt{7} \\cdot a = x \\cdot \\sqrt{5} \\cdot b$\n\nNow, let's find the coordinates of point $A$ by substituting the equation of the tangent line into the equation of the hyperbola:\n\n$\\frac{x^2}{7} - \\frac{(\\sqrt{7} \\cdot a \\cdot x)^2}{5} = 1$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$\\frac{x^2}{7} - \\frac{7a^2 \\cdot x^2}{5} = 1$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 35, we get:\n\n$5x^2 - 49a^2x^2 = 35$\n\nFactoring out $x^2$, we have:\n\n$x^2(5 - 49a^2) = 35$\n\nSince point $A$ lies on both the hyperbola and the tangent line, we can substitute $y = \\sqrt{7} \\cdot a \\cdot x$ into the equation of the tangent line:\n\n$\\frac{(\\sqrt{7} \\cdot a \\cdot x)^2}{5} = 1$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$7a^2x^2 = 5$\n\nNow, we can equate the two expressions for $x^2$:\n\n$\\frac{5 - 49a^2}{5 - 49a^2} = \\frac{5}{7a^2}$\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n$35 - 245a^2 = 25$\n\nSolving for $a^2$, we have:\n\n$a^2 = \\frac{10}{245} = \\frac{2}{49}$\n\nNow, we can find the value of $\\frac{7}{a^2} - \\frac{5}{b^2}$:\n\n$\\frac{7}{\\frac{2}{49}} - \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 49}{2} - \\frac{5 \\cdot \\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{343}{2} - 5 = \\frac{293}{2}$\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{293}{2}}\\]\n\nNote: The given problem statement seems to have a mistake in the final answer, as it should be $\\frac{293}{2}$ instead of $\\frac{7}{a^2} - \\frac{5}{b^2}$. The correct expression for the final answer is $\\frac{293}{2}$.\n\n\n\nGiven a hyperbola $\\Gamma: \\frac{x^{2}}{7}-\\frac"}

Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:\n\n$A-T \\leq 2^{n}-n-1$\n\n$\\Rightarrow T \\geq n$\n\nEquality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nNext, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\\left\\{0,1, \\cdots, 2^{n}-1\\right\\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \\in\\{1,2 n-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, there are two paths: $\\{0,2,1,3\\}$ and $\\{0,2,3,1\\}$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.\n\n(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\\left\\{0,2,4, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\\right\\}$.\n(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\\left\\{1,3,5, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\\right\\}$.\n(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.\n\nTherefore, we can use the path $0 \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-2\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right) \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nIn this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct_response": " To minimize the reciprocal sum $T$, we want to minimize the step lengths while still covering all points in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, \\cdots, 2^{2024}-1\\}$.\n\nSince the frog can jump left or right, we can pair the smallest and largest numbers, the second smallest and second largest, and so on, to form pairs with a sum of $2^{2024}$. This way, we can cover all points in the set with the smallest possible step lengths.\n\nFor example, the first pair would be $(1, 2^{2024}-1)$, the second pair would be $(2, 2^{2024}-2)$, and so on.

If all three roots of the cubic equation $5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x + 1 = 66p$ are natural numbers, then the sum of all possible values of $p$ is \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}}.\t\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "76 \\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "\\\\\n\\textbf{Approach 1}: Since $5 - 5(p+1) + (77p - 1) + 1 = 66p$, $x=1$ is a natural number solution of the original cubic equation. \n\nBy synthetic division, the cubic equation is reduced to the quadratic equation $5x^2 - 5px + 66p - 1=0$(1). \n\nThis problem is transformed into finding all real numbers $p$ such that the equation (1) has two natural number solutions. \n\nLet $u$ and $v(u\\leq v)$ be the two natural number solutions of equation (1). By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\tv+u=p,(2)\\\\\n\tvu=\\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\\:.$(4)\n\nFrom the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. \n\nSince (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition", "microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct_response": " Let's first simplify the given cubic equation:\n\n$5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x + 1 = 66p$\n\n$5x^3 - 5px^2 - 5x^2 + 71px - x + 1 = 66p$\n\nNow, let's move all terms to one side:\n\n$5x^3 - 5px^2 - 5x^2 + 71px - x + 1 - 66p = 0$\n\n$5x^3 - (5p + 5)x^2 + (71p - 1)x - (66p + 1) = 0$\n\nNow, we know that all three roots of this cubic equation are natural numbers.
