Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough.

Thus, $m+n=6$.", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition", "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_response": "### Step 1: First, we need to find the equation of the hyperbola $\\Gamma$ using the given point $M(3,\\sqrt{2})$.\nSince the point $M(3,\\sqrt{2})$ lies on the hyperbola $\\Gamma$, we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation of the hyperbola to obtain $\\frac{3^2}{a^2}-\\frac{(\\sqrt{2})^2}{b^2}=1$.\n\n### Step 2: Now, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nUsing the equation of the hyperbola, we have $\\frac{9}{a^2}-\\frac{2}{b^2}=1$. We also know that $c=2$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to the focus. Since $c^2=a^2+b^2$, we can substitute the value of $c$ to obtain $4=a^2+b^2$. Solving this equation, we get $a^2=3$ and $b^2=1$. Therefore, $a=\\sqrt{3}$ and $b=1$.\n\n### Step 3: Next, we need to find the coordinates of the right focus $F(2,0)$.\nThe right focus $F$ has coordinates $(c,0)$, where $c=2$. So, the coordinates of $F$ are $(2,0)$.\n\n### Step 4: Now, we can find the equation of the line $l$ passing through the right focus $F(2,0)$.\nThe slope of the line $l$ is $\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\\frac{0-0}{2-3}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. The equation of the line $l$ in slope-intercept form is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+b$. Since the line passes through the point $(2,0)$, we can substitute the values to obtain $0=-\\frac{1}{2}(2)+b$, which gives $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line $l$ is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+1$.\n\n### Step 5: We need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ where the line $l$ intersects the right branch of the hyperbola $\\Gamma$.\nTo find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the line $l$ and the hyperbola $\\Gamma$. Substituting $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+1$ into the equation of the hyperbola, we get $\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{(-\\frac{1}{2}x+1)^2}{b^2}=1$. Simplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{x^2}{3}-\\frac{1}{4}x^2-\\frac{1}{4}x^2+1=1$, which gives $\\frac{x^2}{3}-\\frac{3}{4}x^2=0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=\\frac{12}{5}$ and $x=-\\frac{12}{5}$.\n\n### Step 6: Now, we can find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ using the values of $x$.\nThe $x$-coordinate of point $A$ is $\\frac{12}{5}$ and the $x$-coordinate of point $B$ is $-\\frac{12}{5}$. To find the $y$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we can substitute these values into the equation of the line $l$: $y_A=-\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{12}{5})+1$ and $y_B=-\\frac{1}{2}(-\\frac{12}{5})+1$. Simplifying these expressions, we get $y_A=-\\frac{6}{5}+1=-\\frac{1}{5}$ and $y_B=\\frac{6}{5}+1=\\frac{11}{5}$.\n\n### Step 7: Next, we need to find the coordinates of point $P$ where the line $l$ crosses the y-axis.\nTo find the $x$-coordinate of point $P$, we can substitute $y=0$ into the equation of the line $l$: $0=-\\frac{1}{2}x+1$, which gives $x=2$. Therefore, the coordinates of point $P$ are $(2", "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_answer": "### Step 1: First, we need to find the equation of the hyperbola $\\Gamma$ using the given point $M(3,\\sqrt{2})$.\nSince the point $M(3,\\sqrt{2})$ lies on the hyperbola $\\Gamma$, we can substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the equation of the hyperbola to obtain $\\frac{3^2}{a^2}-\\frac{(\\sqrt{2})^2}{b^2}=1$.\n\n### Step 2: Now, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\nUsing the equation of the hyperbola, we have $\\frac{9}{a^2}-\\frac{2}{b^2}=1$. We also know that $c=2$, where $c$ is the distance from the center to the focus. Since $c^2=a^2+b^2$, we can substitute the value of $c$ to obtain $4=a^2+b^2$. Solving this equation, we get $a^2=3$ and $b^2=1$. Therefore, $a=\\sqrt{3}$ and $b=1$.\n\n### Step 3: Next, we need to find the coordinates of the right focus $F(2,0)$.\nThe right focus $F$ has coordinates $(c,0)$, where $c=2$.

The equation of the line $l$ in slope-intercept form is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+b$. Since the line passes through the point $(2,0)$, we can substitute the values to obtain $0=-\\frac{1}{2}(2)+b$, which gives $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line $l$ is $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+1$.\n\n### Step 5: We need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ where the line $l$ intersects the right branch of the hyperbola $\\Gamma$.\nTo find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the line $l$ and the hyperbola $\\Gamma$. Substituting $y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+1$ into the equation of the hyperbola, we get $\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{(-\\frac{1}{2}x+1)^2}{b^2}=1$. Simplifying this equation, we get $\\frac{x^2}{3}-\\frac{1}{4}x^2-\\frac{1}{4}x^2+1=1$, which gives $\\frac{x^2}{3}-\\frac{3}{4}x^2=0$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=\\frac{12}{5}$ and $x=-\\frac{12}{5}$.\n\n### Step 6: Now, we can find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ using the values of $x$.\nThe $x$-coordinate of point $A$ is $\\frac{12}{5}$ and the $x$-coordinate of point $B$ is $-\\frac{12}{5}$. To find the $y$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, we can substitute these values into the equation of the line $l$: $y_A=-\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{12}{5})+1$ and $y_B=-\\frac{1}{2}(-\\frac{12}{5})+1$. Simplifying these expressions, we get $y_A=-\\frac{6}{5}+1=-\\frac{1}{5}$ and $y_B=\\frac{6}{5}+1=\\frac{11}{5}$.\n\n### Step 7: Next, we need to find the coordinates of point $P$ where the line $l$ crosses the y-axis.\nTo find the $x$-coordinate of point $P$, we can substitute $y=0$ into the equation of the line $l$: $0=-\\frac{1}{2}x+1$, which gives $x=2$.

Hence, $2\\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\t\\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n)$.

{"problem_id": "Problem_129", "question": "Given an integer $n > 2$. Now, there are $n$ people playing a game of \"Passing Numbers\". It is known that some people are friends (friendship is mutual), and each person has at least one friend. The rules of the game are as follows: each person first writes down a positive real number, and the $n$ positive real numbers written by everyone are all different; then, for each person, if he has $k$ friends, he divides the number he wrote by $k$, and tells all his friends the result obtained; finally, each person writes down the sum of all the numbers he hears. The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "2\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.\n\nLet the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$.\n\nConsider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n)$.\n\nUnder this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \\leq i \\leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time. From the conclusion, we know that at least one person writes down a smaller number the second time, thus, there must be another person who writes down a larger number the second time, so at least 2 people write down different numbers twice.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_response": "### Minimum Number of Times Someone Writes Down Different Numbers\n\nLet's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1.

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$. Consequently, the total number of functions $f$ with a fixed point is calculated as $\\sum\\limits_{c=1}^n(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2=C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.\nAs a result, the number of functions $f$ without a fixed point is found as $C_{2n-1}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-1}=C_{2n-2}^{n-2}$.

This means that for any two holidays, the colors of the hats worn by all dwarves are different. This condition is crucial for determining the maximum number of holidays.\n\n### Step 3:  Identifying the key constraint\nThe key constraint here is that for any two holidays, there is at least one dwarf who wears hats of different colors on the two occasions.

Let's start by subtracting the first equation from the fourth equation, which gives us $-2c_1 + 2c_4 = 0$, or $c_1 = c_4$.\n## Step 6:  Next, we can substitute $c_1 = c_4$ into the second equation, which gives us $c_1 + 2c_2 + c_3 + ac_4 + bc_5 = 0$. Since $c_1 = c_4$, we have $2c_2 + c_3 + ac_4 + bc_5 = 0$.\n## Step 7:  Now, let's substitute $c_1 = c_4$ into the third equation, which gives us $c_1 + c_2 - c_3 + a + c_4 - c_5 = 0$. Since $c_1 = c_4$, we have $2c_2 - c_3 + a + c_4 - c_5 = 0$.\n## Step 8:  Subtracting the second equation from the third equation, we get $-c_3 + (a - 2c_2 + c_4 - c_5) = 0$.

When $n=2024$, the minimum value of $T$ is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "2024\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "For a positive integer $n$, we prove that the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nFirst, we provide an estimation.\n\nInitially, we notice that the frog's jump length must be one of the terms in the set $\\left\\{2^{0}, 2^{1}, \\cdots, 2^{n-1}\\right\\}$; otherwise, it would jump out of bounds.\n\nLet $a_{i}$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$) denote the number of times the frog jumps $2^{i}$ steps. According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.\n\nLemma: For any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n-k} \\leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:\n\n$A-T \\leq 2^{n}-n-1$\n\n$\\Rightarrow T \\geq n$\n\nEquality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nNext, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\\left\\{0,1, \\cdots, 2^{n}-1\\right\\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \\in\\{1,2 n-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, there are two paths: $\\{0,2,1,3\\}$ and $\\{0,2,3,1\\}$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.\n\n(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\\left\\{0,2,4, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\\right\\}$.\n(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\\left\\{1,3,5, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\\right\\}$.\n(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.\n\nTherefore, we can use the path $0 \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-2\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right) \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nIn this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.", "label": "Combinatorics", "level": "high school competition", "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_response": "### Answer: 2024\n\nTo find the minimum value of T, we need to minimize the sum of the reciprocals of the step lengths.\n\nSince the frog jumps to each point in the set {1, 2, 3,..., 2^n - 1} exactly once, the sum of the reciprocals of the step lengths is minimized when the frog jumps with the smallest possible step lengths.\n\nThe smallest possible step lengths are 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4,..., 2^(n-1) = 2^(n-1). \n\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the step lengths is:\n1 + 2 + 4 +... + 2^(n-1) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 +... + 2^(n-1) = 2^(n) - 1.\n\nSo, the minimum value of T is:\nT = (2^(n) - 1) / (2^(n-1)) = 2 - 1 / 2^(n-1) = 2 - 1 / 2^(n-1) = 2 - 1 / 2^(2024 - 1) = 2 - 1 / 2^2023.\n\nThis is the minimum value of T for any positive integer n.", "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_answer": "### Answer: 2024\n\nTo find the minimum value of T, we need to minimize the sum of the reciprocals of the step lengths.\n\nSince the frog jumps to each point in the set {1, 2, 3,..., 2^n - 1} exactly once, the sum of the reciprocals of the step lengths is minimized when the frog jumps with the smallest possible step lengths.\n\nThe smallest possible step lengths are 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4,..., 2^(n-1) = 2^(n-1). \n\nTherefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the step lengths is:\n1 + 2 + 4 +... + 2^(n-1) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 +... + 2^(n-1) = 2^(n) - 1.\n\nSo, the minimum value of T is:\nT = (2^(n) - 1) / (2^(n-1)) = 2 - 1 / 2^(n-1) = 2 - 1 / 2^(n-1) = 2 - 1 / 2^(2024 - 1) = 2 - 1 / 2^2023.\n\nThis is the minimum value of T for any positive integer n."}

This implies that the last two digits of \\((\\overline{1})^{3}\\) can be \\(01, 26, 51,\\) or \\(76\\).

This can be further simplified to $5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x - 66p - 1 = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Use Vieta's formulas to relate the coefficients to the roots\nBy Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is $-\\frac{-5(p+1)}{5} = p + 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Express the product of the roots using Vieta's formulas\nThe product of the roots is $-\\frac{-66p - 1}{5}$.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the product of the roots to determine possible values of $p$\nWe need to find the values of $p$ for which the product of the roots is a positive integer. Let $r$ be the product of the roots, then $r = (p + 1)(71p - 1)(66p + 1)$.\n\n### Step 6: Factorize the expression and find the possible values of $p$\nWe need to factorize the expression $(p + 1)(71p - 1)(66p + 1)$ and find the values of $p$ for which $r$ is a positive integer.\n\n### Step 7: Find the values of $p$ that satisfy the conditions\nWe need to find the values of $p$ for which the expression $(p + 1)(71p - 1)(66p + 1)$ is a positive integer.\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the sum of all possible values of $p$\nOnce we have found the possible values of $p$, we need to calculate their sum.\n\nAfter detailed calculations and factorization, we find that the possible values of $p$ are $p = -2$ and $p = 1$. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $p$ is $-2 + 1 = -1$.\n\n\n### Answer: -1"}
