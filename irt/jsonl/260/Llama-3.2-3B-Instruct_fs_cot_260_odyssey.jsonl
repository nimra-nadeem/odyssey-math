Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

In this case, we need to consider the maximum number of points that can be enclosed by a single circle.\n\n## Step 8: Realize the relationship with the number of points\nThe number of points is 2019, which is an odd number. This means that we cannot divide the points evenly into two groups.\n\n## Step 9: Apply the Pigeonhole Principle\nThe Pigeonhole Principle states that if $n$ items are put into $m$ containers, with $n > m$, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In this case, we can apply this principle to find the minimum number of circles required.\n\n## Step 10: Calculate the minimum number of circles\nUsing the Pigeonhole Principle, we can conclude that the minimum number of circles required is at least $\\lceil \\frac{2019}{2} \\rceil = 1010$. However, this is still not the correct answer as it assumes that each point can be enclosed by a separate circle.\n\n## Step 11: Consider the correct scenario\nIn the correct scenario, we need to consider the maximum number of points that can be enclosed by a single circle. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of points that can be enclosed by a single circle in a convex polygon.\n\n## Step 12: Apply the formula for the maximum number of points enclosed by a circle\nThe maximum number of points enclosed by a circle in a convex polygon can be calculated using the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\n## Step 13: Calculate the minimum number of circles\nUsing the formula, we can calculate the minimum number of circles required as $\\lceil \\frac{2019}{\\frac{n}{2} + 1} \\rceil$, where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.\n\n## Step 14: Find the correct value of n\nSince the points are arranged on a plane, we can assume that the polygon is a convex polygon with the maximum number of sides. In this case, the maximum number of sides is equal to the number of points.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the minimum number of circles\nUsing the correct value of $n$, we can calculate the minimum number of circles required as $\\lceil \\frac{2019}{\\frac{2019}{2} + 1} \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{2019}{1010} \\rceil = \\lceil 2 \\rceil = 3$.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{3}$"}

However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends.

Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition.

We need to find the sum of the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ to the equations $f(x)+x=2$ and $g(x)+x=2$ respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the equation $f(x)+x=2$\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly monotonically increasing, the equation $f(x)+x=2$ has at most one solution. Let's call this solution $x_1$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the equation $g(x)+x=2$\nSimilarly, the equation $g(x)+x=2$ has at most one solution. Let's call this solution $x_2$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the property of inverse functions\nSince $g(x)$ is the inverse function of $f(x)$, we have $f(g(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$. Substituting $x_2$ into this equation, we get $f(g(x_2))=x_2$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $x_2$ into the equation $f(x)+x=2$\nSince $x_2$ is a solution to the equation $g(x)+x=2$, we have $g(x_2)+x_2=2$.

Substituting this into the equation from Step 5, we get $x_2+g(x_2)=2$.\n\n## Step 7: Compare the equations $g(x_2)+x_2=2$ and $x_2+g(x_2)=2$\nSince both equations equal 2, we can set them equal to each other: $g(x_2)+x_2=x_2+g(x_2)$. Subtracting $x_2$ from both sides, we get $g(x_2)=g(x_2)$. This equation is true for all $x_2$, so we can't find a specific value for $x_2$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$\nFrom the equation $f(x)+x=2$, we have $x_1=f(x_1)+x_1=2$. Subtracting $x_1$ from both sides, we get $f(x_1)=x_1$. Substituting $x_1$ into the equation $f(g(x))=x$, we get $f(g(x_1))=x_1$. Since $g(x_1)=x_1$, we have $f(x_1)=x_1$. This shows that $x_1$ is a fixed point of the function $f(x)$.\n\n## Step 9: Use the property of inverse functions again\nSince $g(x)$ is the inverse function of $f(x)$, we have $f(g(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$. Substituting $x_2$ into this equation, we get $f(g(x_2))=x_2$. Since $f(x)$ is strictly monotonically increasing, we have $f(g(x_2))<f(g(x_1))=x_1$. This implies that $x_2<x_1$.\n\n## Step 10: Use the fact that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are solutions to the equations $f(x)+x=2$ and $g(x)+x=2$ respectively\nSince $x_1$ is a solution to the equation $f(x)+x=2$, we have $x_1+f(x_1)=2$. Similarly, since $x_2$ is a solution to the equation $g(x)+x=2$, we have $x_2+g(x_2)=2$.\n\n## Step 11: Add the two equations from Step 10\nAdding the two equations, we get $x_1+x_2+f(x_1)+g(x_2)=4$.\n\n## Step 12: Use the fact that $f(g(x_2))=x_2$\nFrom Step 9, we have $f(g(x_2))=x_2$. Substituting this into the equation from Step 11,", "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct_answer": "## Step 1: Understand the problem statement\nWe are given a strictly monotonically increasing function $y=f(x)$ and its inverse function $y=g(x)$. We need to find the sum of the solutions $x_1$ and $x_2$ to the equations $f(x)+x=2$ and $g(x)+x=2$ respectively.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze the equation $f(x)+x=2$\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly monotonically increasing, the equation $f(x)+x=2$ has at most one solution. Let's call this solution $x_1$.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the equation $g(x)+x=2$\nSimilarly, the equation $g(x)+x=2$ has at most one solution. Let's call this solution $x_2$.\n\n## Step 4: Use the property of inverse functions\nSince $g(x)$ is the inverse function of $f(x)$, we have $f(g(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$. Substituting $x_2$ into this equation, we get $f(g(x_2))=x_2$.\n\n## Step 5: Substitute $x_2$ into the equation $f(x)+x=2$\nSince $x_2$ is a solution to the equation $g(x)+x=2$, we have $g(x_2)+x_2=2$. Substituting $x_2$ into the equation $f(x)+x=2$, we get $f(g(x_2))+g(x_2)=2$.\n\n## Step 6: Use the result from Step 4\nFrom Step 4, we have $f(g(x_2))=x_2$. Substituting this into the equation from Step 5, we get $x_2+g(x_2)=2$.\n\n## Step 7: Compare the equations $g(x_2)+x_2=2$ and $x_2+g(x_2)=2$\nSince both equations equal 2, we can set them equal to each other: $g(x_2)+x_2=x_2+g(x_2)$. Subtracting $x_2$ from both sides, we get $g(x_2)=g(x_2)$. This equation is true for all $x_2$, so we can't find a specific value for $x_2$.\n\n## Step 8: Find the relationship between $x_1$ and $x_2$\nFrom the equation $f(x)+x=2$, we have $x_1=f(x_1)+x_1=2$. Subtracting $x_1$ from both sides, we get $f(x_1)=x_1$. Substituting $x_1$ into the equation $f(g(x))=x$, we get $f(g(x_1))=x_1$. Since $g(x_1)=x_1$, we have $f(x_1)=x_1$. This shows that $x_1$ is a fixed point of the function $f(x)$.\n\n## Step 9: Use the property of inverse functions again\nSince $g(x)$ is the inverse function of $f(x)$, we have $f(g(x))=x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $g$. Substituting $x_2$ into this equation, we get $f(g(x_2))=x_2$. Since $f(x)$ is strictly monotonically increasing, we have $f(g(x_2))<f(g(x_1))=x_1$. This implies that $x_2<x_1$.\n\n## Step 10: Use the fact that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are solutions to the equations $f(x)+x=2$ and $g(x)+x=2$ respectively\nSince $x_1$ is a solution to the equation $f(x)+x=2$, we have $x_1+f(x_1)=2$. Similarly, since $x_2$ is a solution to the equation $g(x)+x=2$, we have $x_2+g(x_2)=2$.\n\n## Step 11: Add the two equations from Step 10\nAdding the two equations, we get $x_1+x_2+f(x_1)+g(x_2)=4$.\n\n## Step 12: Use the fact that $f(g(x_2))=x_2$\nFrom Step 9, we have $f(g(x_2))=x_2$.

We can find the valid values of $n$ by checking the remainders of multiples of 64 when divided by 25.\n\n## Step 5:  Check the remainders of multiples of 64 when divided by 25 to find valid values of n.\nWe can calculate the remainders of multiples of 64 when divided by 25 to find the valid values of $n$.

Therefore, $\\frac{a_n(\\sqrt{R_n} - \\sqrt{R_{n+1}})}{R_n - R_{n+1}} \\leq \\frac{a_n}{R_n - R_{n+1}}$.\n\n## Step 5: Evaluate the series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{R_n - R_{n+1}}$\nWe can rewrite the series as $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{R_n - R_{n+1}} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{R_n - R_{n+1}}{\\sqrt{R_n} - \\sqrt{R_{n+1}}} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{R_n}{\\sqrt{R_n} - \\sqrt{R_{n+1}}} - \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{R_{n+1}}{\\sqrt{R_n} - \\sqrt{R_{n+1}}}$.\n\n## Step 6: Telescoping the series\nThe two series in the previous step telescope, meaning that most of the terms cancel out. We are left with $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{R_n}{\\sqrt{R_n} - \\sqrt{R_{n+1}}} = \\frac{R_1}{\\sqrt{R_1} - \\sqrt{R_2}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{4} - \\sqrt{0}} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the final expression\nSince $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{\\sqrt{R_n}+\\sqrt{R_{n+1}}} \\leq \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{R_n - R_{n+1}}$, we have $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{\\sqrt{R_n}+\\sqrt{R_{n+1}}} \\leq 2$. However, we can also show that $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{\\sqrt{R_n}+\\sqrt{R_{n+1}}} \\geq \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{2\\sqrt{R_n}}$.\n\n## Step 8: Evaluate the final expression\nSince $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n = 4$, we have $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{2\\sqrt{R_n}} \\leq \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{"}

It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps.
