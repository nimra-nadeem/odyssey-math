The UMP test is a powerful test when the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is small. In this case, the sample size is large, and the critical value is small, indicating that the UMP test is a powerful test."}

Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points.

Note that \n\t\\[ \\alpha^{n+2} - \\beta^{n+2} = (\\alpha + \\beta)(\\alpha^{n+1} - \\beta^{n+1}) - \\alpha\\beta(\\alpha^n - \\beta^n) = (\\alpha^{n+1} - \\beta^{n+1}) + (\\alpha^n - \\beta^n), \\]\n\twhich implies $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n$.\n\t\\item Given the conditions, we know that $b$ divides $\\alpha_1 - 2\\alpha$, i.e., $b | 1 - 2\\alpha$. Since $b > \\alpha$, we have $b = 2\\alpha - 1$. Furthermore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $b | \\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n$, $b | \\alpha_{n+1} - 2(n+1)\\alpha^{n+1}$, and $b | \\alpha_{n+2} - 2(n+2)\\alpha^{n+2}$. Combining these with $\\alpha_{n+2} = \\alpha_{n+1} + \\alpha_n$ and $b = 2\\alpha - 1$ being odd, we get\n\t\\[ b | (n+2)a^{n+2} - (n+1)a^{n+1} - na^n. \\]\n\tSince $(b, a) = 1$, we have $b | (n+2)a^2 - (n+1)a - n$.\n\t\\item By setting $n$ to $n+1$ in the above equation, we get $b | (n+3)a^2 - (n+2)a - (n+1)$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields $b | a^2 - a - 1$, i.e., $2a - 1 | a^2 - a - 1$. So, $2a - 1 | 2a^2 - 2a - 2$. Since $2\\alpha^2 \\equiv \\alpha \\pmod{2\\alpha - 1}$, we have $2\\alpha - 1 | -\\alpha - 2$ and $2\\alpha - 1 | -2\\alpha - 4$. Thus, $2\\alpha - 1 | -5$, implying $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ or $5$. However, $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ leads to $b = \\alpha$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $2\\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\t\\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n)$. For $n = 1, 2$, we have $\\alpha_1 = 1$ and $\\alpha_2 = \\alpha + \\beta = 1$, so $\\alpha_1 - 2 \\times 3 = -5$ and $\\alpha_2 - 2 \\times 2 \\times 3^2 = -35$, which confirms the condition. Assuming the condition holds for $n = k, k+1$, we can prove it for $n = k+2$ as well.

It is known that some people are friends (friendship is mutual), and each person has at least one friend. The rules of the game are as follows: each person first writes down a positive real number, and the $n$ positive real numbers written by everyone are all different; then, for each person, if he has $k$ friends, he divides the number he wrote by $k$, and tells all his friends the result obtained; finally, each person writes down the sum of all the numbers he hears. The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "2\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.\n\nLet the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$.\n\nConsider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n)$.\n\nUnder this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \\leq i \\leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time.

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$. Consequently, the total number of functions $f$ with a fixed point is calculated as $\\sum\\limits_{c=1}^n(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2=C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.\nAs a result, the number of functions $f$ without a fixed point is found as $C_{2n-1}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-1}=C_{2n-2}^{n-2}$.

We can represent the problem as a tree, where each node represents a set of colors, and each edge represents a set of hats. We can then recursively expand the tree, and at each node, we can choose the best set of colors to expand based on the current solution.\n\nAt each node, we can use a heuristic function to estimate the cost of expanding the node. For example, we can use the minimum cost of expanding the node to find the best set of colors to expand. We can also use a heuristic function that estimates the cost of expanding the node to find the best set of hats to expand.\n\nWe can then use a backtracking algorithm to find the best solution. At each node, we can backtrack to the previous node if the current solution is not optimal, and we can try to expand the tree in a different direction.\n\nIn the problem you provided, we have $66$ hats and $111$ hats, and each dwarf is wearing one of their hats.

According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.\n\nLemma: For any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n-k} \\leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$.

If all three roots of the cubic equation $5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x + 1 = 66p$ are natural numbers, then the sum of all possible values of $p$ is \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}}.\t\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "76 \\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "\\\\\n\\textbf{Approach 1}: Since $5 - 5(p+1) + (77p - 1) + 1 = 66p$, $x=1$ is a natural number solution of the original cubic equation. \n\nBy synthetic division, the cubic equation is reduced to the quadratic equation $5x^2 - 5px + 66p - 1=0$(1). \n\nThis problem is transformed into finding all real numbers $p$ such that the equation (1) has two natural number solutions. \n\nLet $u$ and $v(u\\leq v)$ be the two natural number solutions of equation (1). By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\tv+u=p,(2)\\\\\n\tvu=\\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\\:.$(4)\n\nFrom the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. \n\nSince (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition", "allenai/OLMo-7B-Instruct_response": "The cubic equation you provided has three complex roots, so it's not a cubic equation with all real roots.
