Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough.

We can use these relationships to simplify the expression:\n\n$2n\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\alpha^{n-1} + \\alpha^{n-2}\\beta + \\ldots + \\alpha\\beta^{n-2} + \\beta^{n-1}\\right)$\n\n$= 2n\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\alpha^{n-1} + \\alpha^{n-2}(\\alpha + 1) + \\ldots + \\alpha(\\alpha + 1)^{n-2} + (\\alpha + 1)^{n-1}\\right)$\n\nNow, we can see that the expression inside the parentheses is a sum of terms involving powers of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Since $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are roots of the equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$, they are related by the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n$\\alpha^{n+1} = \\alpha^n + \\alpha^{n-1}$\n\n$\\beta^{n+1} = \\beta^n + \\beta^{n-1}$\n\nUsing this relationship, we can rewrite the expression inside the parentheses as a sum of Fibonacci numbers:\n\n$2n\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(F_1 + F_2 + \\ldots + F_{n-1} + F_n\\right)$\n\nNow, we know that the sum of the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers is given by:\n\n$F_1 + F_2 + \\ldots + F_n = F_{n+2} - 1$"}

{"problem_id": "Problem_129", "question": "Given an integer $n > 2$. Now, there are $n$ people playing a game of \"Passing Numbers\". It is known that some people are friends (friendship is mutual), and each person has at least one friend. The rules of the game are as follows: each person first writes down a positive real number, and the $n$ positive real numbers written by everyone are all different; then, for each person, if he has $k$ friends, he divides the number he wrote by $k$, and tells all his friends the result obtained; finally, each person writes down the sum of all the numbers he hears. The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent", "answer": "2\\\\\n\\noindent", "reasoning": "At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.\n\nLet the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$.\n\nConsider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n)$.\n\nUnder this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \\leq i \\leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time.

So, for each element, there are 10 - 1 = 9 choices that do not result in a fixed point.\n\nThere are 10 elements, so the total number of functions without fixed points is $9^{10}$.\n\nThe number of functions with fixed points is the total number of functions minus the number of functions without fixed points. The total number of functions is $10^{10}$ (since each element has 10 choices for its image).\n\nSo, the number of functions with fixed points is $10^{10} - 9^{10}$.\n\n2. Functions without fixed points:\n\nWe have already calculated this as $9^{10}$.\n\nThe difference between the number of functions with fixed points and without fixed points is:\n\n$$(10^{10} - 9^{10}) - 9^{10} = 10^{10} - 2 \\cdot 9^{10}$$\n\n### Answer: $10^{10} - 2 \\cdot 9^{10}$"}

The slope of the tangent line to the hyperbola at any point $(x_0, y_0)$ can be found by differentiating the equation with respect to $x$:\n\n$\\frac{2x}{7} - \\frac{2yy'}{5} = 0$\n\nSolving for $y'$ (the slope of the tangent line):\n\n$y' = \\frac{5x}{7y}$\n\nAt point $A$, the slope of the tangent line is:\n\n$m_t = \\frac{5x_A}{7y_A}$\n\nNow, we can use the relationship between the slopes:\n\n$m_l \\cdot m_t = -1$\n\n$-\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{5x_A}{7y_A} = -1$\n\nSince the tangent line passes through point $A$, we can substitute the coordinates of $A$ into the equation of the hyperbola:\n\n$\\frac{x_A^2}{7} - \\frac{y_A^2}{5} = 1$\n\nNow, we can solve for $x_A^2$ and $y_A^2$:\n\n$x_A^2 = 7(1 + \\frac{y_A^2}{5})$\n\n$y_A^2 = 5(1 + \\frac{x_A^2}{7})$\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the equation relating the slopes:\n\n$-\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{5 \\cdot 7(1 + \\frac{y_A^2}{5})}{7y_A} = -1$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$-\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{5(1 + \\frac{5y_A^2}{5})}{y_A} = -1$\n\n$-\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{5 + 5y_A^2}{y_A} = -1$\n\nNow, we can use the expressions for $x_A^2$ and $y_A^2$ to eliminate $y_A$:\n\n$-\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{5 + 5 \\cdot 5(1 + \\frac{x_A^2}{7})}{5(1 + \\frac{x_A^2}{7})} = -1$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$-\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{5 + 25 + 25x_A^2/7}{5 + 5x_A^2/7} = -1$\n\n$-\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{30 + 25x_A^2/7}{5 + 5x_A^2/7} = -1$\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by $-1$ and simplify:\n\n$\\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{5 + 5x_A^2/7}{30 + 25x_A^2/7} = 1$\n\nNow, we can find the expression for $\\frac{7}{a^2} - \\frac{5}{b^2}$:"}

Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\left[(\\overline{1 b})^{3}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{13 d}=\\overline{1 b 3} \\times 1000\n$$\n\nHowever, since there are 3 factors of 5 on the right side of the equation, and \\(\\overline{13 d}\\) can only provide at most 1 factor of 5, we infer that \\((\\overline{1 b})^{3}-1\\) must be a multiple of 25. This implies that the last two digits of \\((\\overline{1})^{3}\\) can be \\(01, 26, 51,\\) or \\(76\\).

Hence, \\(a\\) can be \\(2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\). However, since \\(\\overline{a 2 d}\\) cannot be 125 or 625, it can provide at most 2 factors of 5.

So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. \n\nSince (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition", "microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct_response": " Let's first rewrite the given cubic equation:\n\n$5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x + (66p - 1) = 0$\n\nSince all three roots are natural numbers, let's denote them as $a$, $b$, and $c$.
