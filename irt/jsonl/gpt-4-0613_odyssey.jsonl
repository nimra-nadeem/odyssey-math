Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough.

This gives:\n\n$\\frac{3^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(\\sqrt{2})^2}{b^2} = 1$\n\n$\\frac{9}{a^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2} = 1$\n\nWe use the fact that the distance from the centre to the focus of the hyperbola is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$. Since this distance is $2$, we have $a^2 + b^2 = 4$.\n\nSubstituting $a^2 = 4 - b^2$ into the equation above, we get two equations:\n\n$\\frac{9}{4 - b^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2} = 1$ and $a^2 + b^2 = 4$\n\nSolving the two equations, we get $b^2 = \\frac{8}{5}$ and $a^2 = \\frac{12}{5}$. \n\nEvery line passing through a focus of the hyperbola crosses its corresponding branch in the vertices of the branch. So points $A$ and $B$ are vertices of the right branch of the hyperbola. Therefore, $A = F + a\\overrightarrow{i}$ and $B = F - a\\overrightarrow{i}$.\n\nSince vector $\\overrightarrow{AF} = - a\\overrightarrow{i}$ and $\\overrightarrow{BF} = a\\overrightarrow{i}$, we have, given that $\\overrightarrow{PA} = m\\overrightarrow{AF}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB} = n\\overrightarrow{BF}$:\n\n$\\overrightarrow{PA} = - ma\\overrightarrow{i}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB} = na\\overrightarrow{i}$\n\nBecause $P$ lies on the y-axis, its x-coordinate is $0$.
