There are ${7\\choose2} = 21$ possible ways to choose the two non-adjacent elements, and for each choice, the two elements can be swapped in two different ways.

Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent",
            "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent",
            "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points. Thus, the proposition is proved.",

In this case, we can draw one circle passing through all the points and divide the plane into two closed shapes. Therefore, $k$ must be at least 1.\n\nNow let's prove that $k = 1$ is sufficient. Suppose we can draw one circle that divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points.\n\nFirst, we prove that there is at least one closed shape. If there is no closed shape, it means that all the shapes are open shapes (half-planes), and each shape contains at most one point (since there is no closed shape containing two points). But then the total number of points would be at most the number of open shapes, which is at most 2018. This contradicts the fact that there are 2019 points.\n\nTherefore, there is at least one closed shape. Let's assume this closed shape contains point A. Now consider another point B that is not in the closed shape. Since the closed shape is closed, there must exist a line passing through A and B that does not intersect the closed shape. This means we can draw a circle passing through A and B that does not intersect the closed shape. Therefore, we can draw one circle that divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $k$ is 1. \n\nFinal Answer: [[1]].",

            "gpt-35-turbo-0613_response": "To find the maximum value of $c$, we can start by considering the conditions given in the question. \n\nFor $0 < \\frac{a_i}{b_i} < 1$, it means that the ratio of $a_i$ to $b_i$ is between 0 and 1. Therefore, $a_i < b_i$ for all $i$.\n\nNext, let's consider the expression $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$. Since $a_i < b_i$ for all $i$, we can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\n\nFrom the conditions given, we know that $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers and positive even numbers respectively. This means that the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ is a sum of positive even integers.\n\nTo maximize the value of $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$, we need to maximize the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$. One way to do this is to maximize each individual $a_i$.\n\nSince $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers and positive even numbers respectively, we can choose $a_i = b_i - 1$ for each $i$. This ensures that $a_i < b_i$ and maximizes the value of $a_i$ given the condition.\n\nUsing this choice of $a_i$, we have $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n (b_i - 1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i - n$. \n\nSubstituting this into the expression $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$, we get $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i - n}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} - \\frac{n}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} - \\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$.\n\nTo maximize this expression, we want to maximize $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$ while minimizing $\\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$. \n\nSince $\\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ decreases as $n$ increases, we can minimize it by choosing the largest possible value for $n$.\n\nTherefore, to maximize the value of $c$, we need to consider the limit as $n$ approaches infinity.\n\nTaking the limit as $n$ approaches infinity, we have $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} - \\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right)$.\n\nSince $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$ is a finite sum and $n^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ approaches infinity as $n$ approaches infinity, the term $\\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ becomes negligible compared to $\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\n\nTherefore, in the limit as $n$ approaches infinity, we have $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} - \\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (2i)}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of the first $n$ positive even integers, we can simplify the expression to $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\cdot \\binom{n+1}{2}}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\n\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, we can further simplify the expression to $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\cdot \\frac{(n+1)!}{2!(n-1)!}}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(n+1)n(n-1)}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n^3 - n}{n^{\\frac{3}{2}}}$.\n\nSimplifying the expression further, we get $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(n^{\\frac{3}{2}} - \\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right)$.\n\nSince $n^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ approaches infinity and $\\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ approaches 0 as $n$ approaches infinity, the term $\\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}$ becomes negligible compared to $n^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n\nTherefore, in the limit as $n$ approaches infinity, we have $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(n^{\\frac{3}{2}} - \\frac{1}{n^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right) \\approx \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\infty$.\n\nThus, the maximum value of $c$ is infinity.\n\nFinal Answer: $c = \\infty$.",

            "gpt-35-turbo-0613_response": "We first need to find the equation of the hyperbola $\\Gamma$. We are given that it passes through the point $M(3,\\sqrt{2})$, which means we can substitute these coordinates into the equation of the hyperbola to solve for $a$ and $b$. Plugging in $x=3$ and $y=\\sqrt{2}$, we have:\n$$\\frac{3^2}{a^2} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}^2}{b^2} = 1$$\n$$\\frac{9}{a^2} - \\frac{2}{b^2} = 1$$\nMultiplying through by $a^2b^2$ and rearranging, we get:\n$$9b^2 - a^2 = a^2b^2$$\n$$a^2b^2 + a^2 - 9b^2 = 0$$\nUsing this quadratic equation, we can solve for $b^2$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$b^2 = \\frac{-a^2 \\pm \\sqrt{a^4 + 36a^2}}{2}$$\n\nSince the hyperbola opens in the x-direction, the value of $a$ is the distance from the center to the vertex, and since the distance from the vertex to the focus is given as 2 units, $a=2$. Substituting this into the quadratic equation, we have:\n$$b^2 = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{4^4 + 36\\cdot4}}{2}$$\n$$b^2 = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{256 + 144}}{2}$$\n$$b^2 = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{400}}{2}$$\n$$b^2 = \\frac{-4 \\pm 20}{2}$$\n$$b^2 = 8, -12$$\nSince the value of $b^2$ must be positive, we have $b^2=8$.\n\nSo the equation of the hyperbola $\\Gamma$ is:\n$$\\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{y^2}{8} = 1$$\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of the right focus $F$. Since $F$ is $(2,0)$, we know that $c=2$. The relationship between $a$, $b$, and $c$ for a hyperbola is given by the equation $c^2=a^2+b^2$. Plugging in the values $c=2$ and $a=2$, we can solve for $b^2$:\n$$2^2 = 2^2 + b^2$$\n$$4 = 4 + b^2$$\n$$b^2 = 0$$\n\nSo the focus $F$ is at $(2,0)$.\n\nNow we can find the equation of line $l$. Since $l$ passes through point $F(2,0)$, we can use the point-slope form of a line and the slope of $l$ to write the equation. To find the slope of $l$, we can use the slope between $F$ and $A$, which is the same as the slope between $F$ and $B$. Since $A$ and $B$ lie on the right branch of $\\Gamma$, we can find their $x$-coordinates by setting $y=0$ in the equation of $\\Gamma$. Plugging this in, we have:\n$$\\frac{x^2}{4} - \\frac{0}{8} = 1$$\n$$\\frac{x^2}{4} = 1$$\n$$x^2 = 4$$\n$$x = \\pm 2$$\n\nSo the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $\\pm 2$. From the given information, we know that $A$ and $B$ are on line $l$ and that $F$ is also on line $l$. Therefore, the slope of $l$ is given by:\n$$m_{l} = \\frac{0 - 0}{2 - (-2)} = 0$$\n\nSo the equation of line $l$ is $y = 0$.\n\nNext, we need to find the coordinates of point $P$, where line $l$ crosses the y-axis. Since the equation of line $l$ is $y=0$, we know that the $y$-coordinate of point $P$ is 0. To find the $x$-coordinate of point $P$, we can substitute the coordinates of $P$ into the equation of line $l$:\n$$0 = 0$$\nSince this is true for all $x$-values, we can say that the $x$-coordinate of $P$ can be any real number.\n\nNow we can find the vectors $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB}$. The coordinates of $A$ are $(2,0)$, so $\\overrightarrow{PA} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{P} - 2 \\\\ y_{P} - 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{P} - 2 \\\\ y_{P} \\end{bmatrix}$. Similarly, the coordinates of $B$ are $(-2,0)$, so $\\overrightarrow{PB} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{P} + 2 \\\\ y_{P} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nFinally, we can express $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB}$ in terms of the right focus vector $\\overrightarrow{AF}$ and $\\overrightarrow{BF}$. The coordinates of $F$ are $(2,0)$, so $\\overrightarrow{AF} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{A} - 2 \\\\ y_{A} - 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. Similarly, $\\overrightarrow{BF} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{B} - 2 \\\\ y_{B} - 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -4 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nTo express $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{AF}$, we need to find $x_{P}-2$ and $y_{P}$ in terms of $x_{A}-2$ and $y_{A}-0$. Since $y_{A}$ is 0, $y_{P}$ must also be 0. For $x_{P}$, we can say that $x_{P}-2$ is equal to $-k$ times $x_{A}-2$, where $k$ is a constant. So we can write the equation $x_{P}-2=-k(x_{A}-2)$. Plugging in the values for $x_{P}$ and $x_{A}$, we have $-k \\cdot (2-2) = 0$, so $x_{P}-2=0$. Therefore, $\\overrightarrow{PA}=0 \\cdot \\overrightarrow{AF} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nSimilarly, we can express $\\overrightarrow{PB}$ in terms of $\\overrightarrow{BF}$. Since $y_{P}$ is 0, $y_{B}$ must also be 0. For $x_{P}$, we can say that $x_{P}+2$ is equal to $k$ times $x_{B}-2$, where $k$ is a constant. So we can write the equation $x_{P}+2=k(x_{B}-2)$. Plugging in the values for $x_{P}$ and $x_{B}$, we have $k \\cdot (-2-2) = -4k = -2$, so $x_{P}+2=2(x_{B}-2)$. Therefore, $\\overrightarrow{PB}=2 \\cdot \\overrightarrow{BF} = \\begin{bmatrix} -8 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. \n\nNow we can find $m+n$ by summing the components of $\\overrightarrow{PA}$ and $\\overrightarrow{PB}$:\n$$m+n = 0 + (-8) = -8$$\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Final Answer: [[-8]].",

            "gpt-35-turbo-0613_response": "We approach this problem using casework on the powers of $2$. \nCase 1: $ab - c = bc - a = ca - b = 1$\nIn this case, we must have $ab - c = bc - a = ca - b = 1$, from which we obtain $ab = c+1$, $bc = a+1$, and $ca = b+1$. It follows that $abc + a + b + c  = 3 + ab + bc + ca = 5(a+b+c) = 3(a+b+c) + 3(a+b+c) + 3 = 3(a+b+c)+8$. Since $abc = (c+1)(a+1) = b+1$, we have the equation $5(a+b+c) = 3(a+b+c) + 5$, or $2(a+b+c) = 5$. However, the sum $a + b + c$ must be an integer, so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nCase 2: $ab - c = bc - a = ca - b = 2$\nSimilarly to Case 1, we obtain $abc + a + b + c  = 4 + ab + bc + ca = 6(a+b+c) = 3(a+b+c) + 9$, so $2(a+b+c) = 3$. This has no solutions because $a+b+c$ must be an integer.\n\nCase 3: $ab - c = bc - a = 4$ and $ca - b = 2$\nNow, we have $ab = c+4$, $bc = a+4$, and $ca = b+2$. Adding these three equations and rearranging, we obtain $abc = 3(a+b+c) + 6$, or $a + b + c = \\frac{abc - 6}{3}$. It follows that $a + b + c$ is divisible by $3$.\nSubcase 3.1: $a + b + c = 3$\nIn this subcase, we have $ab = c+4$, $bc = a+4$, and $ca = b+2$, so adding these three equations and rearranging gives $abc + a + b + c = 6(a+b+c) = 18$. Dividing through by $a+b+c$, we obtain $bc + ca + ab + 1 = 6$. \nIf $a = 1$, $bc + c + b + 1 = bc + b + c = 5$, so there are no solutions for $b$ and $c$.\nIf $b = 1$, the equation simplifies to $c^2 + c + c + 1 = 5$, so $c^2 + 2c - 4 = 0$. This quadratic has no integer solutions.\nIf $c = 1$, the equation becomes $b^2 + b + b + 1 = 5$, so $b^2 + 2b - 4 = 0$. This quadratic has no integer solutions.\nHence, there are no solutions in this subcase.\nSubcase 3.2: $a + b + c = 6$\nSimilarly to subcase 3.1, we obtain the equation $bc + ca + ab + 1 = 18$, so let $x = a+b$, $y = b+c$, and $z = c+a$. Our equation becomes $(x-z)(y-x) + (y-x)(z-y) + (z-y)(x-z) + 1 = 18$, or $xz + yz + xy - 3(x+y+z) - 17 = 0$. \nUsing the fact that $a + b + c = 6$ and $x + y + z = 2(a+b+c) = 12$, we can solve for $x$, $y$, and $z$ to find that $x = \\frac{3}{2}, y = \\frac{15}{2},$ and $z = \\frac{15}{2}$.

            "reasoning": "Using a recursive approach, let $S_{n}$, denote the number of n-digit numbers formed by the digits $1,2, \\cdots, 6$ such that 1 and 6 are not adjacent. \n\nClearly, $S_{1}=6$ and $S_{2}=6^{2}-2=34$. Now we establish the recursive formula for $S_n$. We divide $S_n$ into three categories: \n\nLet $a_{n}$ denote the number of nn-digit numbers with the first digit being 1, $b_{n}$ denote the number of nn-digit numbers with the first digit being 2, 3, 4, or 5, and $c_{n}$ \n\nIt's evident that $S_{n}=a_{n}+b_{n}+c_{n}$, and\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\na_{n}=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}, \\\\\nb_{n}=4\\left(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}\\right), \\\\\nc_{n}=b_{n-1}+c_{n-1} .\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThen $S_{n}=5\\left(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1}+c_{n-1}\\right)+b_{n-1}$\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n=5 S_{n-1}+4 S_{n-2}(n \\geqslant 3) . \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nFrom $S_{1}=6$ and $S_{2}=34$ and we get \n$S_{3}=194, S_{4}=1106, S_{5}=6306 $.\n\nSubtracting the cases where there is exactly one digit or exactly two digits, and 1 and 6 are not adjacent, from $S_{5}$, there are  $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{6}^{2}-1\\right)\\left(2^{5}-2\\right)=420$. \n\nTherefore, the number of five-digit numbers satisfying the condition is  6306-6-420=5880.",

            "gpt-35-turbo-0613_response": "To solve this question, we can use the principle of counting.\n\nFirst, we count the number of five-digit numbers that have exactly three different digits. We have five choices for the digit in the thousands place, and then we have six choices for the two remaining different digits in the other four places. Finally, we have $\\binom{4}{2}$ ways to arrange these two different digits in the remaining four places. So the total number of five-digit numbers with exactly three different digits is $5 \\times 6 \\times \\binom{4}{2} = 180$.\n\nNext, we count the number of five-digit numbers that have exactly four different digits. We have six choices for the digit in the thousands place, and then we have $\\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the two remaining different digits for the other four places. Finally, we have $4!$ ways to arrange these four different digits in the remaining four places. So the total number of five-digit numbers with exactly four different digits is $6 \\times \\binom{5}{2} \\times 4! = 720$.\n\nFinally, we count the number of five-digit numbers that have exactly five different digits. We have six choices for the digit in the thousands place, and then we have $5!$ ways to arrange the remaining five different digits in the other four places. So the total number of five-digit numbers with exactly five different digits is $6 \\times 5! = 720$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of five-digit numbers that have at least three different digits and 1 and 6 are adjacent. We can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: 1 is in the thousands place and 6 is in the units place. In this case, we have 4 choices for the remaining digit in the units place. The remaining three places can be filled with the other three digits in $3!$ ways. So the total number of five-digit numbers in this case is $4 \\times 3! = 24$.\n\nCase 2: 6 is in the thousands place and 1 is in the units place. In this case, we again have 4 choices for the remaining digit in the units place. The remaining three places can be filled with the other three digits in $3!$ ways. So the total number of five-digit numbers in this case is also $4 \\times 3! = 24$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of five-digit numbers that have at least three different digits and 1 and 6 are adjacent is $24 + 24 = 48$.\n\nFinally, the number of five-digit numbers satisfying the condition of having at least three different digits and 1 and 6 not being adjacent is the total number of five-digit numbers minus the number of five-digit numbers that have at least three different digits and 1 and 6 are adjacent, which is $180 + 720 + 720 - 48 = 1572$.\n\nFinal Answer: [[1572]].",
