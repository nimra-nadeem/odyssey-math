Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent",
            "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent",
            "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points. Thus, the proposition is proved.",

When $n=k+1$, consider positive integers $a_{i}$ and positive even numbers $b_{i}(i=1,2, \\cdots, k+1)$ satisfying conditions. Next, we aim to prove that there exists $i_{0} \\in\\{1,2, \\cdots, k+1\\}$, such that $b_{i_{0}} \\geq 2 \\sqrt{k+1}$.\\\\\nAssume that the conclusion is not true, then for each $i=1,2, \\cdots, k+1$, we have $2 \\leq b_{i}<2 \\sqrt{k+1}$. Without loss of generality, suppose that the sequence $\\left\\{b_{i}\\right\\}(i=1,2, \\cdots, k+1)$ is arranged in increasing order. Set $\\sqrt{k+1}=m+a$, where,  $m=[\\sqrt{k+1}]$ ( $[x]$ denotes the greatest integer not exceeding $x$), $0 \\leq a<1$. Then $2 \\leq b_{i}<2 \\sqrt{k+1}=2 m+2 a<2 m+2 \\Rightarrow 2 \\leq b_{i} \\leq 2 m+1$. Since $b_{i}$ is even number, thus, $2 \\leq b_{i} \\leq 2 m$.\\\\\nFor positive integer $j(1 \\leq j \\leq m)$, the number of positive integers $a_{i}$ satifying $b_{i}=2 j$ is at most $2 j-1$, i.e., $a_{i} \\in\\{1,2, \\cdots, 2 j-1\\}$. Therefore, $n=k+1 \\leq \\sum_{j=1}^{m}(2 j-1)=m^{2}$.\\\\\nThus, $m \\geq \\sqrt{k+1} \\geq m$, which implies that all equalities hold, i.e., $m=\\sqrt{k+1}$, $n=k+1=\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(2 j-1)=m^{2}$, $b_{k+1}=2 \\sqrt{k+1}$, contradiction.\nTherefore, there exists $i_{0} \\in\\{1,2, \\cdots, k+1\\}$, such that $b_{i_{0}} \\geq 2 \\sqrt{k+1}$.\\\\\nFrom the induction hypothesis, we can obtain\n\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} b_{i}=\\sum_{\\substack{i=1 \\\\ i \\neq i_{0}}}^{k+1} b_{i}+b_{i_{0}}>\\frac{4}{3} k^{\\frac{3}{2}}+2 \\sqrt{k+1}$.\\\\\nTo prove that equation (1) holds when n=k+1$ it suffices to show \\frac{4}{3} k^{\\frac{3}{2}}+2 \\sqrt{k+1} \\geq \\frac{4}{3}(k+1)^{\\frac{2}{2}}$. Notice that, equation (2)\n\n$\\Leftrightarrow \\frac{4}{3} k \\sqrt{k}+2 \\sqrt{k+1} \\geq \\frac{4}{3}(k+1) \\sqrt{k+1}$\n\n$\\Leftrightarrow 2 k \\sqrt{k}+3 \\sqrt{k+1} \\geq 2(k+1) \\sqrt{k+1}$\n\n$\\Leftrightarrow \\sqrt{k+1} \\geq 2 k(\\sqrt{k+1}-\\sqrt{k})$.\\\\\nFrom $2 k(\\sqrt{k+1}-\\sqrt{k})=\\frac{2 k}{\\sqrt{k+1}+\\sqrt{k}}<\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{k}}=\\sqrt{k}<\\sqrt{k+1}$.\\\\\nThen equation (3) holds, thus equation (2) holds, thereby completing the proof of equation (1). From equation (1), we know that when $c=\\frac{4}{3}$, the original inequality holds.\\\\\nTherefore, $c_{\\text {max }}=\\frac{4}{3}$.",

It is known that some people are friends (friendship is mutual), and each person has at least one friend. The rules of the game are as follows: each person first writes down a positive real number, and the $n$ positive real numbers written by everyone are all different; then, for each person, if he has $k$ friends, he divides the number he wrote by $k$, and tells all his friends the result obtained; finally, each person writes down the sum of all the numbers he hears. The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent",
            "answer": "2\\\\\n\\noindent",
            "reasoning": "At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.\n\nLet the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$.\n\nConsider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n)$.\n\nUnder this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \\leq i \\leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time. From the conclusion, we know that at least one person writes down a smaller number the second time, thus, there must be another person who writes down a larger number the second time, so at least 2 people write down different numbers twice.",

Alice assigns a value to one of the variables (either x or y) and tells Bob which variable she has assigned and what value.\n3. Bob assigns a value to the other variable.\n4. They each calculate the product of the values on their two cards.\n\nTo determine who has a winning strategy, we need to consider the possible values Alice can assign and the possible values Bob can assign.\n\nLet's assume Alice assigns a value to x. Then, Bob can assign a value to y. The possible products Alice can get are:\n\n* From the card with expression x+y: Alice's value for x times Bob's value for y\n* From the card with expression x^2+xy+y^2: Alice's value for x squared plus Bob's value for y times Alice's value for x plus Bob's value for y squared\n* From the card with expression x^2-xy+y^2: Alice's value for x squared minus Bob's value for y times Alice's value for x plus Bob's value for y squared\n\nNow, let's assume Alice assigns a value to y. Then, Bob can assign a value to x. The possible products Bob can get are:\n\n* From the card with expression x+y: Bob's value for x times Alice's value for y\n* From the card with expression x^2+xy+y^2: Bob's value for x squared plus Alice's value for y times Bob's value for x plus Alice's value for y squared\n* From the card with expression x^2-xy+y^2: Bob's value for x squared minus Alice's value for y times Bob's value for x plus Alice's value for y squared\n\nNotice that the possible products for Alice and Bob are symmetric. This means that if Alice assigns a value to x, Bob can assign a value to y and get the same possible products as Alice. Similarly, if Alice assigns a value to y, Bob can assign a value to x and get the same possible products as Alice.\n\nSince the possible products are symmetric, neither Alice nor Bob has a winning strategy. They can always respond to each other's moves and get the same possible products.\n\n### Answer: C. Neither of them has a winning strategy."

If all 51 people fail to guess correctly, it implies that the numbers from 1 to 51 are all in the last 49 positions, which is clearly contradictory. For 50 people, the permutation arranged by the host can be constructed as follows: fill in numbers from 1 to 100 in the positions 1 to 100 successively, ensuring that each number differs from the guesses of the 50 participants (at least 50 different numbers). If, for any position $\\mathrm{k}$, it's not possible to do so, it implies that at least 50 numbers that could have been placed in position $\\mathrm{k}$ have already been placed elsewhere. Since any number not yet placed can be placed in at most 50 different positions (including position $\\mathrm{k}$), there will always be a number that can replace the one initially placed at position $\\mathrm{k}$. This process ensures that all 50 participants fail to guess correctly.",

Since $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant 2019$, we conclude that $f(2020) = 101$.",

As $|x|\\to\\infty$, the term $|x|^{100}$ grows exponentially faster than the term $\\ln(100+|x|^{100})$, which grows logarithmically.

As $|x|\\to\\infty$, $f(x)\\to\\infty$. Since $|u(x)|\\leq f(x)$, we know that $|u(x)|$ grows at most linearly with $|x|$.\n\nNext, let's consider the Laplacian of $u$, denoted by $\\Delta u$. Since $u$ is harmonic, $\\Delta u=0$.

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$.

Equating this to the characteristic equation, we get $e^{-x_0} = e^{-x(t)}$, which simplifies to $x(t) = x_0$.\n\nNow, we need to satisfy the boundary condition $u(t, 0) = A + Bt$ for $t > 0$. Since $x(t) = 0$, we can substitute this into the characteristic equation to get $u(t, 0) = u(0, 0) = e^0 = 1$. Equating this to the boundary condition, we get $A + Bt = 1$.\n\nTo find the values of $A$ and $B$, we need to ensure that the solution $u(t, x)$ is $C^1$ in the region $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$. This means that the solution must be continuous and have continuous first derivatives in this region.\n\nFrom the characteristic equation, we know that $u(t, x) = e^{-x(t)} = e^{-2t - x_0}$. Taking the derivative of this expression with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = -e^{-2t - x_0}$. Taking the derivative of this expression with respect to $t$, we get $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t \\partial x} = -2e^{-2t - x_0}$.\n\nSince we need the solution to be $C^1$ in the region $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$, we need the derivatives of the solution to be continuous in this region. This means that the expressions $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t \\partial x}$ must be continuous in this region.\n\nFrom the expression for $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$, we can see that it is continuous in the region $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$, since $e^{-2t - x_0}$ is continuous in this region.\n\nFrom the expression for $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t \\partial x}$, we can see that it is not continuous in the region $\\{t = 0, x \\leq 0\\}$, since $e^{-2t - x_0}$ is not continuous at $t = 0$. This means that the solution $u(t, x)$ is not $C^1$ in the region $\\{t = 0, x \\leq 0\\}$.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the boundary condition $u(t, 0) = A + Bt$ for $t > 0$. We can do this by adding a new term to the boundary condition, which is proportional to $\\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function. This new term will ensure that the solution $u(t, x)$ is $C^1$ in the region $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$.\n\nThe modified boundary condition is then $u(t, 0) = A + Bt + C \\delta(t)$ for $t > 0$, where $C$ is a constant. Since we need the solution $u(t, x)$ to be $C^1$ in the region $\\{t \\geq 0, x \\leq 0\\}$, we can set $C = 0$, which gives us the original boundary condition $u(t, 0) = A + Bt$ for $t > 0$.\n\nTo find the values of $A$ and $B$, we can substitute the original boundary condition into the characteristic equation and solve for $A$ and $B$. This gives us the values $A = 1$ and $B = 0$, which satisfy the original boundary condition and ensure",

Since the ages are normally distributed, we can use the sample variance to estimate the population variance.\n\nThe sample variance is calculated as:\n\n$$s^2 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$\n\nwhere $x_i$ are the individual ages, $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, and $n$ is the sample size.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sample mean:\n\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{39 + 54 + 61 + 72 + 59}{5} = 54.2$$\n\nNext, let's calculate the deviations from the mean:\n\n$$x_i - \\bar{x} = \\{-15, 0, 7, 18, 5\\}$$\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the squared deviations:\n\n$$\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = (-15)^2 + 0^2 + 7^2 + 18^2 + 5^2 = 450$$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the sample variance:\n\n$$s^2 = \\frac{450}{5-1} = 90$$\n\nTo find the 99% confidence interval, we need to use the chi-squared distribution. The critical value for a 99% confidence interval with $n-1 = 4$ degrees of freedom is approximately 15.52 (from a chi-squared distribution table or calculator).\n\nThe 99% confidence interval for the population variance is:\n\n$$\\chi^2_{lower} = 15.52 - 90 = 0.52$$\n\n$$\\chi^2_{upper} = 15.52 + 90 = 105.52$$\n\nThe 99% confidence interval for the population variance is therefore:\n\n$$[0.52, 105.52]$$\n\n### Answer: [0.52, 105.52]"

During the holiday, each dwarf wears his own hat. It is known that for any holiday, the colors of the hats worn by all dwarves are different. For any two holidays, there is at least one dwarf who wears hats of different colors on the two occasions. The question is: how many holidays can the dwarves celebrate at most? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent",

Each way of wearing hats that satisfies the requirements for every holiday is a perfect match of \\(G\\). The problem is to find the maximum number \\(f(G)\\) of different perfect matches for graph \\(G\\).\n\nThe lemma states that for a bipartite graph \\(G\\left(V_{1}, V_{2} ; E\\right)\\) with \\(\\left|V_{1}\\right|=\\left|V_{2}\\right|\\), it holds that \\(f(G) \\leq 2^{\\left[\\frac{|E|-\\left|E_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right]}\\), where \\([x]\\) represents the largest integer not exceeding the real number \\(x\\).\n\nProof is by mathematical induction.\n\nIt is easy to prove that when \\(\\left|V_{1}\\right|=\\left|V_{2}\\right|=1\\), the conclusions hold true.\n\nSuppose the conclusions hold when \\(\\left|V_{1}\\right|=\\left|V_{2}\\right|=n-1(n \\geq 2)\\). Consider the case when \\(\\left|V_{1}\\right|=\\left|V_{2}\\right|=n\\).\n\nConsider the bipartite graph \\(G\\left(V_{1}, V_{2} ; E\\right)\\).\n\nIf \\(G\\) has isolated vertices, then \\(f(G)=0\\), and the conclusions hold true. Otherwise, let \\(a \\in V_{1}\\) be the vertex in \\(G\\) with the smallest degree \\(N(N \\geq 1)\\), and let \\(b_{1}, b_{2}, \\cdots, b_{N}\\) be the neighbors of \\(a\\). Let \\(G_{i}=\\left(U_{i}, U_{i}^{\\prime} ; E_{i}\\right)\\) denote the bipartite graph obtained by deleting vertex \\(a\\) and vertices \\(b_{i}\\), as well as the edges incident to \\(a\\) or \\(b_{i}\\).\n\nThen \\(\\left|U_{i}\\right|=\\left|U_{i}^{\\prime}\\right|=n-1\\), and \\(\\left|E_{i}\\right| \\leq|E|-(2 N-1)\\).\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, it follows that \\(f\\left(G_{i}\\right) \\leq 2^{\\left[\\frac{\\left|E_{i}\\right|-\\left|U_{i}\\right|}{2}\\right]} \\leq 2^{\\left[\\frac{|E|-(2 N-1)-(n-1)}{2}\\right]}=2^{\\left[\\frac{|E|-n}{2}\\right]} \\frac{1}{2^{N-1}}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(f(G)=f\\left(G_{1}\\right)+f\\left(G_{2}\\right)+\\cdots+f\\left(G_{N}\\right) \\leq \\frac{N}{2^{N-1}} 2^{\\left[\\frac{|E|-n}{2}\\right]}\\).\n\nBy Bernoulli's inequality, \\(2^{N-1} \\geq 1+(N-1)=N\\). Thus, \\(f(G) \\leq \\frac{N}{2^{N}} 2^{\\left[\\frac{|E|-n}{2}\\right]} \\leq 2^{\\left[\\frac{|E|-n}{2}\\right]}\\).\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nIn particular, when \\(n=66,|E| \\leq 111\\),\n\n\\(f(G) \\leq 2^{\\left[\\frac{111-66}{2}\\right]}=2^{22}\\).\n\nOn the other hand, let graph \\(G\\) be composed of 22 complete bipartite graphs \\(K_{2,2}\\) and one bipartite graph \\(K_{1,1}\\). In this case, \\(|E|=110\\), and each complete bipartite graph \\(K_{2,2}\\) has 2 perfect matches, so \\(f(G)=2^{22}\\).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of different perfect matches is \\(2^{22}\\).",

Therefore, the total number of distinct intersection points is:\n\n45/2 = 22.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an intersection point, we round down to 22.\n\n### Answer: 22"

            "answer": "2024\\\\\n\\noindent",
            "reasoning": "For a positive integer $n$, we prove that the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nFirst, we provide an estimation.\n\nInitially, we notice that the frog's jump length must be one of the terms in the set $\\left\\{2^{0}, 2^{1}, \\cdots, 2^{n-1}\\right\\}$; otherwise, it would jump out of bounds.\n\nLet $a_{i}$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$) denote the number of times the frog jumps $2^{i}$ steps. According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.\n\nLemma: For any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n-k} \\leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:\n\n$A-T \\leq 2^{n}-n-1$\n\n$\\Rightarrow T \\geq n$\n\nEquality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nNext, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\\left\\{0,1, \\cdots, 2^{n}-1\\right\\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \\in\\{1,2 n-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, there are two paths: $\\{0,2,1,3\\}$ and $\\{0,2,3,1\\}$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.\n\n(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\\left\\{0,2,4, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\\right\\}$.\n(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\\left\\{1,3,5, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\\right\\}$.\n(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.\n\nTherefore, we can use the path $0 \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-2\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right) \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nIn this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.",

Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\left[(\\overline{1 b})^{3}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{13 d}=\\overline{1 b 3} \\times 1000\n$$\n\nHowever, since there are 3 factors of 5 on the right side of the equation, and \\(\\overline{13 d}\\) can only provide at most 1 factor of 5, we infer that \\((\\overline{1 b})^{3}-1\\) must be a multiple of 25. This implies that the last two digits of \\((\\overline{1})^{3}\\) can be \\(01, 26, 51,\\) or \\(76\\). By considering the units place, we find that \\(b=1\\) or \\(6\\), but neither of these options satisfies the conditions.\n\nNext, let's explore the case where \\(c=2\\). This yields:\n\n$$\n\\left[(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000}\n$$\n\nFrom this equation, we deduce that:\n\n$$(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1=1000 \\times \\frac{\\overline{a b 2}}{\\overline{a 2 d}}$$\n\nBecause \\(0.5<\\frac{\\overline{a b 2}}{\\overline{a 2 d}}<2\\), we conclude that \\(500<(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1<2000\\). Hence, \\(a\\) can be \\(2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\). However, since \\(\\overline{a 2 d}\\) cannot be 125 or 625, it can provide at most 2 factors of 5. Therefore, \\((\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\) must be a multiple of 5, leading to the possible values \\(b=1, 9, 4,\\) or \\(6\\).\n\nBased on the equation \\(\\left[(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000}\\), we have:\n\n(1) \\((\\overline{a b}+1) \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000} \\div(\\overline{a b}-1)>1000\\)\n\n(2) \\((\\overline{a b}-1) \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000} \\div(\\overline{a b}+1)<1000\\)\n\nConsequently, \\(a\\) can only be 3. Then, \\((\\overline{a b}-1) \\times(\\overline{a b}+1)\\) cannot be a multiple of 25, implying that \\(\\overline{a 2 d}\\) must be a multiple of 25. Thus, \\(d=5\\), and \\(\\overline{a 2 d}=325\\).\n\nNow, \\((\\overline{3 b}-1) \\times(\\overline{3 b}+1) \\times 325=\\overline{3 b 2000}\\), where \\(\\overline{3 b 2000}\\) is a multiple of 16. This means that either \\((\\overline{3 b}-1)\\) or \\((\\overline{3 b}+1)\\) must be a multiple of 8. Therefore, \\(b\\) can be 1 or 3. Since \\(a=3\\), \\(b\\) can only be 1.\n\nAfter verifying: \\(31^{2} \\times 325=312325\\), so \\(\\overline{a b c d}=3125\\).",

We can find this area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)bh\n\nwhere b is the base length and h is the height.\n\nThe base length is the distance between the points A and E, which is:\n\nAE = sqrt((1-0.5)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = sqrt(0.25) = 0.5\n\nThe height is the distance from the point A to the plane AEF, which is:\n\nh = |<1,0,0> dot <0.5,0,0> + <0,1,0> dot <0.5,0,0> + <0,0,1> dot <0.5,0,0.5>| - 0.75 = 0.25\n\nNow, we can find the area of the triangle AEF:\n\nArea = (1/2)(0.5)(0.25) = 0.0625\n\n### Answer: 0.0625"

We have:\n\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} y_3 = A y_3$$\n\nSubstituting $y_3$ into the ODE, we get:\n\n$$A y_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 x \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nSince $y_3$ is a non-zero vector, this implies that $A y_3 = 0$ only if $A = 0$. However, this is not possible since $y_3$ is not the zero vector.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that it is impossible to find a system of three linear homogeneous ODEs such that all of $y_1, y_2, y_3$ are solutions to this homogeneous ODE system.\n\n### Answer: No."

By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\tv+u=p,(2)\\\\\n\tvu=\\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\\:.$(4)\n\nFrom the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. \n\nSince (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.",
