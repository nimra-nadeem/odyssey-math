This function is a convex function because the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) (which is \\(2b\\)) is greater than zero.\n\nNext, for this function to be greater than or equal to zero for \\(x \\in [-1, 1]\\), it must reach its minimum value at \\(x = 0\\). This is because the function \\(2bx^2 + ax + 1 - b\\) will be a maximum when \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 1\\), and a minimum at \\(x = 0\\) based on the properties of quadratic functions. \n\nSubstitute \\(x = 0\\) into the given function to find the minimum value:\n\n\\(2b * 0^2 + a * 0 + 1 - b = 1 - b\\)\n\nBecause this is the minimum value of the function on the interval, we have \\(1 - b \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow b \\leq 1\\).\n\nAlso, for the function to be greater than or equal to zero within the interval, the value of the function at the ends of the interval (at \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 1\\)) should be greater than or equal to the minimum value. Hence, substitute both \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 1\\) into the function:\n\nFor \\(x = -1\\), the function is \\(2b * (-1)^2 + a * (-1) + 1 - b = 1 + b - a\\)\nFor \\(x = 1\\), the function is \\(2b * 1^2 + a * 1 + 1 - b = 1 + b + a\\)\n\nThe value of the function at both ends of the interval must be greater than or equal to the minimum value.

Thus, E1 = 2 + E2.\n\nAt the second door, there are two equally likely options: return to door 1 (which costs 2 coins) or proceed to door 3 (which also costs 2 coins).

Drawing circles passing through these points, a drawing method is called \"$k$-good\" if and only if drawing $k$ circles divides the plane into several closed shapes, and there is no closed shape containing two points. Then, find the minimum value of $k$ , it ensures that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $k$-good drawing method.\n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent",
            "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent",
            "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points. Thus, the proposition is proved.",

However, we know for a positive integer $a$, $a^{3} \\mod 1000$ is a three-digit number that gives the last three digits of a cube of $a$. So, essentially we are looking for a number `n` such that $n^{3}$ mod 1000 = 888. \n\nThe minimum such positive integer `n` can be found by brute force via programming or by using mathematical reasoning. Upon checking or by using some mathematical reasoning, we can find out that it is `12`. \n\nExplanation: The cubes of some numbers like 0, 1, 2,... up to 13 are:\n0   ->  000,\n1   ->  001, \n2   ->  008,\n3   ->  027,\n4   ->  064,\n5   ->  125,\n6   ->  216,\n7   ->  343,\n8   ->  512, \n9   ->  729,\n10 -> 1000,\n11 -> 1331,\n12 -> 1728,\n13 -> 2197.\n\nOnly for n=12, we get the last three digits as 728, which are similar to the last three digits as 888 except for the second digit. Also, the cube of 13 results in change of hundreds place to 2, so upon observing the trend of hundreds place i.e., increasing by 1 after few numbers being cubed, one can say the number `12` is the answer. i.e., the smallest number `n` such that last three digits of `n^{3}` are 888 does not exist, thus we can consider the smallest number `n` such that the last digits of `n^{3}` are similar to 888 as the answer. \n\nHowever, if we want specifically the last three digits to be 888, such a number `n` does not exist by mathematical logic nor by brute force checking. But by adjusting the reasoning slightly and considering the last three digits to be similar to 888, 12 as smallest `n` can be an acceptable answer.\n\n### Answer: There is no such positive integer n for which the last three digits of n cube are 888.

This is because $a_i - i$ is used in a logarithmic expression with 2 as the base. For this expression to be a non-negative integer, $\\left|a_{i}-i\\right|+1$ must be a power of 2; which, in turn, requires the absolute value to be 0 or a power of 2 minus 1.\n\nNext, note that $a_{4}$ must be at least 6, meaning the fourth term of the sequence can only be 6, 7, 8, or 9. For each of these four possibilities, consider the requirement that $1 \\leqslant a_{1} \\leqslant a_{2} \\leqslant a_{3} \\leqslant a_{4}$.\n\nIf $a_{4} = 6$, the first three terms of the sequence can only be 1, 2, and 3.

            "gpt-4-0613_response": "To answer this problem, let's first consider the total number of possible five-digit numbers that can be formed from the given set of digits, without accounting for the specific conditions. With 6 digits (1 through 6), the count of all possible 5-digit combinations where repetition of digits is allowed is 6^5 = 7776. \n\nHowever, this includes combinations that do not satisfy the conditions set in the question. Therefore, we have to calculate and subtract these unsatisfying combinations from the total.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of 5-digit numbers with less than 3 different digits. They are 6 (all digits are the same), 6x5x5 (four digits are the same, one is different), 6x5x5x5 (three digits are the same, two are different but the same), and 6x15x20 (three digits are the same, the other two are different), giving a total of 6+150+1500+1800=3456.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of 5-digit numbers with 1 and 6 adjacent to each. This equals 2x6^3x5=3600 because there are 2 choices for 1 and 6 being adjacent (1 before 6 or 6 before 1), 4 positions for them, 6^3 choices for the remaining 3 digits, and 5 ways to provide a barrier between 1 and 6 to prevent them from being adjacent.\n\nHowever, the total we have subtracted so far has double counted the numbers that satisfy both conditions. We have to add them back. They are 2x5x5=50 (1 and 6 appear and they are adjacent, three digits are the same), and 2x5x20=200 (1 and 6 appear and they are adjacent, three digits are the same and the other is different), giving a total of 250.\n\nSo the number of five-digit numbers satisfying the condition of having at least three different digits and 1 and 6 not being adjacent equals 7776-3456-3600+250=970. \n\n### Answer: 970",

The number of carries when adding $n$ and $5^5n$ is the same as the number of carries when adding $a_{5}$ and $\\overline{a_{5}a_{4}\\cdots a_{0}}$. \n\nSince\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\\frac{n}{4}-v_5(n!) &= \\left(\\frac{n}{5}+\\frac{n}{25}+\\cdots\\right)-\\left(\\left[\\frac{n}{5}\\right]+\\left[\\frac{n}{25}\\right]+\\cdots\\right) \\\\\n\t&=\\left\\{\\dfrac{n}{5}\\right\\}+\\left\\{\\dfrac{n}{25}\\right\\}+\\cdots\\\\\n\t&=\\frac{a_{0}}{5}+\\frac{5a_{1}+a_{0}}{25}+\\frac{25a_{2}+5a_{1}+a_{0}}{125}+\\cdots\\\\\n\t&=\\frac{a_5+a_4+\\cdots+a_0}{4}\\\\\n\t&\\geqslant\\frac{a_{5}+a_{0}}{4}\\geqslant\\frac{5}{4}>1\n\\end{align*}\n\n\nThis indicates that in the quintile system $a_5$ and $\\overline{a_5a_4\\cdots a_0}$ are carried at least 2 times, then $a_{1}=4$.

Now we need to determine the total power of $5$ that could divide into this sequence.\n\nBy the property of multiplication, the highest power of $5$ that divides a product of factors is the sum of the highest powers of $5$ that divide each factor.\n\nSo, we need to count how many multiples of $5$ are there from $1$ to $5^{5}+1$ and divide it by $l$.\n\nA number is a multiple of $5$ if its last digit is a $0$ or a $5$. Since we are multiplying by $4l$, this means the last digit will cycle through $\\{4,8,2,6,0\\}$ for every $5$ terms.\n\nThis means every $5$th term in the sequence will be a multiple of $5$ which means there are a total of $5^5/5+1 = 5^4+1$ multiples of $5$.\n\nTherefore, for $5^{25l}$ to divide $A_l$, we require $25l \\leq 5^4+1$.

            "reasoning": "\\begin{enumerate}\n\t\\item First, let's prove that for any positive integer $n$, we have $\\alpha_{n+2} = \\alpha_{n+1} + \\alpha_n$. Note that \n\t\\[ \\alpha^{n+2} - \\beta^{n+2} = (\\alpha + \\beta)(\\alpha^{n+1} - \\beta^{n+1}) - \\alpha\\beta(\\alpha^n - \\beta^n) = (\\alpha^{n+1} - \\beta^{n+1}) + (\\alpha^n - \\beta^n), \\]\n\twhich implies $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n$.\n\t\\item Given the conditions, we know that $b$ divides $\\alpha_1 - 2\\alpha$, i.e., $b | 1 - 2\\alpha$. Since $b > \\alpha$, we have $b = 2\\alpha - 1$. Furthermore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $b | \\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n$, $b | \\alpha_{n+1} - 2(n+1)\\alpha^{n+1}$, and $b | \\alpha_{n+2} - 2(n+2)\\alpha^{n+2}$. Combining these with $\\alpha_{n+2} = \\alpha_{n+1} + \\alpha_n$ and $b = 2\\alpha - 1$ being odd, we get\n\t\\[ b | (n+2)a^{n+2} - (n+1)a^{n+1} - na^n. \\]\n\tSince $(b, a) = 1$, we have $b | (n+2)a^2 - (n+1)a - n$.\n\t\\item By setting $n$ to $n+1$ in the above equation, we get $b | (n+3)a^2 - (n+2)a - (n+1)$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields $b | a^2 - a - 1$, i.e., $2a - 1 | a^2 - a - 1$. So, $2a - 1 | 2a^2 - 2a - 2$. Since $2\\alpha^2 \\equiv \\alpha \\pmod{2\\alpha - 1}$, we have $2\\alpha - 1 | -\\alpha - 2$ and $2\\alpha - 1 | -2\\alpha - 4$. Thus, $2\\alpha - 1 | -5$, implying $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ or $5$. However, $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ leads to $b = \\alpha$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $2\\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\t\\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n)$. For $n = 1, 2$, we have $\\alpha_1 = 1$ and $\\alpha_2 = \\alpha + \\beta = 1$, so $\\alpha_1 - 2 \\times 3 = -5$ and $\\alpha_2 - 2 \\times 2 \\times 3^2 = -35$, which confirms the condition. Assuming the condition holds for $n = k, k+1$, we can prove it for $n = k+2$ as well. Hence, $\\left(a, b\\right) = \\left(3, 5\\right)$ satisfies the conditions.\n\\end{enumerate}",

However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends.

Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time.

The sum of the lengths of these edges is 4*(length + width + height). This sum is also the volume of the box, which is length * width * height. \n\nWe are told the length, width, and height are all natural numbers. Natural numbers are positive integers. Let us denote the length, width, and height as l, w, h correspondingly. Then, we have 4l + 4w + 4h = lwh, and after simplifying, we get l + w + h = (1/4)lwh.\n\nTaking into account the restriction on l, w, and h to be natural numbers, we find that the only way to satisfy the equation is if the box is a cube, i.e., l = w = h. Hence, we have 3l = l\u00b3/4 or l\u00b2 = 12, where l, w, h are all natural numbers. The largest natural number not exceeding the square root of 12 is 3.\n\nSubstituting l = 3 back to the previous equation, we find h = w = 3.

            "gpt-4-0613_response": "We first need to understand the question and use the combination formula to simplify the given expression. \n\n$1+C_n^1+C_n^2+C_n^3 = 1 + n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}$\n\nThis is equal to $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} + 1$.\n\nThe given condition that $1+C_n^1+C_n^2+C_n^3$ divides $2^{2000}$ implies that $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} + 1$ being a power of 2.\n\nSince the left-hand side is an integer, we have to find integer solutions to the equation $(n+1)(n+2) = 6(2^k-1)$ where $k \\leq 2000$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $6(2^k-1)$ only includes the primes $2$, $3$, and all the primes greater than or equal to $5$ that divide $2^k-1$. Because $(n+1)(n+2)$ is the product of two consecutive integers, at least one of them is even and at least one of them is a multiple of 3. Thus, the remaining factors of $2^k-1$ formed by primes $5$ or more must be $1$, i.e., $2^k-1$ cannot be a multiple of any prime other than $2$ or $3$.\n\nTherefore, $k$ has to be a power of 2, and $k=2^i$ for some $i$. But it is given that $k \\leq 2000$, so $i \\leq 10$.\n\nNow, we just need to check these $11$ cases $k=1,2,4,8,16,...,1024$ and find possible $n$ values for each $k$.\n\nAfter finding all possible $n$'s, the sum of all $n$'s satisfying this condition is 30.\n\nSo, the sum of all such n is 30.\n\n### Answer: 30.",

            "reasoning": "Let $k$ be a decimal number, and let $s$ be the product of the digits of $k$.\n\nIt's easy to see that $s \\in \\mathbb{N}$, so $8$ divides $k$ and $\\frac{25}{8}k-211 \\geq 0$, implying $k \\geq \\frac{1688}{25}$. Since $k \\in \\mathbb{N}_+$, we have $k \\geq 68$.\n\nAlso, since $8$ divides $k$, the units digit of $k$ must be even, making $s$ even as well. Since $211$ is odd, $\\frac{25}{8}k$ is odd, implying $16$ divides $k$. Let $k=\\overline{a_1a_2\\cdots a_i}$, where $0 \\leq a_i \\leq 9$ for $i=2,3,\\cdots,t$ and $1 \\leq a_1 \\leq 9$.

Upon verification, both $k = 72$ and $k = 88$ satisfy the given condition. Hence, the answer is $72+88=160$.",

Observing $\\frac{25}{8}k-211$, this expression can have the smallest possible integer value only at $k=67$, because for smaller values of $k$, the expression takes a negative value.\n\nAlso, for $k > 84$, $\\frac{25}{8}k-211$ gives a value larger than $100$, which can't be the product of the digits of $k$.\n\nTherefore, the potential values of $k$ can only be between $67$ and $84$, inclusive.\n\nBy inspecting all the integers from $67$ to $84$, we find that only $k=68$ and $k=83$ satisfy the given condition, i.e., for $k=68$ the product of digits $6\\times8 = 48$ equals $\\frac{25}{8}\\times 68-211 = 48$ and for $k=83$ the product of digits $8\\times3 = 24$ equals $\\frac{25}{8}\\times 83-211 = 24$.\n\nSo, the sum of all positive integers $k$ satisfying the above condition is $68 + 83 = 151$.\n\n### Answer: 151",

Also, the product of the digits of a two-digit number is at most $81$. Therefore, we can limit our search for $n$ to the range of $-100$ to $100$.\n\nChecking each $n$ manually would be very time-consuming, so we will take advantage of the factor of $10$ on the left side of the equation. This means that $p(n)$, the product of the digits of $n$, is likely a single digit (as its largest possible value is $9$ when multiplied by $10$). \n\nSo, we look for numbers whose digits multiply to be a single digit. In the span of $-100$ to $100$, the only numbers that fulfill this are from $-9$ to $9$. We omit $0$ as $10*p(0)$ is $0$, but second term of the right side of the equation, which is $0$ so it will fail at $0=-2005$.\n\nChecking $-9$ and $-8$, we find that $-90$ and $80$ are not equal to $n^2 + 4n - 2005$. Multiplying the digits of $-8$ and $-7$ gives $-56$ and $-42$ respectively, which are not single digits -- this violates the earlier analysis that the product of the digits of $n$ should be a single digit.\n\nIn the meantime, the results with $-6$ and $-5$ also violate this condition, and hence, won't need to be verified. \n\nChecking $-4$ and $-3$, we find that $-40$ and $-30$ are $-841$ and $-2041$ respectively. A similar validity failure occurs with $-2$ and $-1$.\n\nChecking for positive $n$, we realize that all single digit positive integers except $1$ and $-1$ would give a product that contributes at least a $10$ to the LHS when multiplied by $10$. Thus, only $1$ and $-1$ remain to be checked. Substituting them into the RHS we get $-2000$ and $-2010$ respectively, which do not equate to $10, -10$. \n\nThus, there are no solutions for the equation in the range of $-100$ to $100$ where any solutions have to be in.

First, let's set up the parameters. We're told that the force required to break a brick is normally distributed with a mean (\u03bc) of 195 and variance of 16, which implies a standard deviation (\u03c3) of \u221a16 = 4. A force of 190 is being applied, which is \u03bc - \u03c3 = 195 - 4 = ? units of standard deviation away from the mean. Let\u2019s denote the number of standard deviations away from the mean as Z, so Z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3 where X is the force applied = 190. \n\n2. Then we calculate this Z-value (Z_190), Z_190 = (190-195)/4 = -1.25. \n\n3. Now we find the probability that a randomly selected brick will break under a force of 190. This is the same as finding P(Z \u2264 Z_190) = P(Z \u2264 -1.25). Consulting a standard normal distribution table, we find P(Z \u2264 -1.25) \u2248 0.1056.\n\n4. The mean and variance of the sample of n bricks are n times the mean and variance of one brick. Thus, the standard deviation of the sample is \u221an times the standard deviation of one brick, or \u221a(300 * 0.1056 * (1 - 0.1056)) = 5.3581.\n\n5. The force of 190 is less than the mean (195), therefore we're dealing with the left side of the bell curve. We then estimate the probability that the sample mean is not more than 190/195, or 0.10. \n\n6. This raises the question: what is the z-score of 0.10? Let's calculate it:\n\n    Z_(0.10) = (0.10 - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n    Z_(0.10) = (0.10 - 0.1056) / 5.3581 \u2248 -0.00104\n\n7. To find P(Z \u2264 Z_(0.10)), we consult the standard normal table again. For Z \u2248 -0.00104, we find that the cumulative probability is approximately 0.5.\n\nSo the estimate of the probability that at most 30 out of 300 bricks selected at random will break under a force of 190 is approximately 0.5.\n\n### Answer: 0.5\n",

User: Question: Several teams are participating in a friendly football match, where any two teams play at most one match against each other. It is known that each team has played 4 matches, and there are no draws. A team is considered a \"weak team\" if it loses at least 2 out of the 4 matches it plays.

            "gpt-4-0613_response": "This question can be broken down in the following way:\n\n- The premise is that \"weak teams\" lose at least 2 out of the 4 matches they play. If there are only 3 weak teams, that implies there are at least 6 winning scenarios (since each of the 3 weak teams could lose 2 matches). \n\n- Each match has a winner and a loser. Therefore, each match provides two played games, one for each team. So, the 6 winning scenarios mean there were at least 6 matches.\n\n- However, the total number of matches must not be less than twice the number of played games for each team. Since each team has played 4 matches, we need at least 8 matches for each \"non-weak\" team. \n\n- Each team plays at most against all other teams once with each game having a winner (no draws).\n\nFollowing these rules:\n\n- The 3 weak teams beat the other 3 weak teams and lost against the other 5 teams. \n- Among these 5 teams, each beat the other 4 and 1 weak team.\n\nSo, the answer is 5 non weak teams + 3 weak teams = 8 teams max.\n\n### Answer: 8",

            "gpt-4-0613_response": "This problem can be solved using the property of a regular polygon that all angles between consecutive vertices are equal. \n\nFor a polygon with n sides, the angle between two adjacent vertices as seen from the centre of the polygon is 360/n degrees. Because we're dealing with a 17-sided regular polygon, the angle between two adjacent vertices would be 360/17 = 21.176 degrees. \n\nIn order to form an acute-angled triangle, none of the angles in the triangle can be 90 degrees or more. This means that we cannot select three points that are five or more vertices apart from each other.\n\nHowever, there are only 4 possible types of triangles which can be made in a 17-gon: triangles formed by vertices that are 4, 5, 6, or 7 vertices apart. Out of these, only the ones that are 4 vertices apart form acute-angled triangles. \n\nThere are a total of 17 ways to select the first vertex. After the first vertex is selected, there are 16 ways to select the second vertex, and 15 ways to select the third vertex. However, we are over-counting by a factor of 3! because we don't care about the order of selecting the vertices. So, the total number of triangles that can be formed is 17 * 16 * 15 / 3! = 680.\n\nOn the other hand, if we choose our first vertex, there are 14 vertices left.

            "answer": "2024\\\\\n\\noindent",
            "reasoning": "For a positive integer $n$, we prove that the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nFirst, we provide an estimation.\n\nInitially, we notice that the frog's jump length must be one of the terms in the set $\\left\\{2^{0}, 2^{1}, \\cdots, 2^{n-1}\\right\\}$; otherwise, it would jump out of bounds.\n\nLet $a_{i}$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$) denote the number of times the frog jumps $2^{i}$ steps. According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.\n\nLemma: For any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n-k} \\leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:\n\n$A-T \\leq 2^{n}-n-1$\n\n$\\Rightarrow T \\geq n$\n\nEquality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nNext, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\\left\\{0,1, \\cdots, 2^{n}-1\\right\\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \\in\\{1,2 n-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, there are two paths: $\\{0,2,1,3\\}$ and $\\{0,2,3,1\\}$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.\n\n(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\\left\\{0,2,4, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\\right\\}$.\n(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\\left\\{1,3,5, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\\right\\}$.\n(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.\n\nTherefore, we can use the path $0 \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-2\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right) \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nIn this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.",

            "gpt-4-0613_response": "Given the nature of the problem, it appears that the best way to get the minimum value of T would be to ensure that the frog makes the longest possible jumps each time, as this would mean fewer jumps total, and thus a lower overall step length.\n\nThe value of n is quite large (2024), and the solution will naturally involve 2 raised to the power of each step, so we can say the frog is doing 2^n - 1 steps each time. The frog can cover maximum distance in each jump by jumping 2^n-1 steps at a time. \n\nGiven this, if you calculate T as the sum of the reciprocals of each of these step lengths, you would get T = 1/(2^0) + 1/(2^1) + 1/(2^2) + ... + 1/(2^n-1) which is a geometric progression.\n\nThe sum S of a geometric series a, ar, ar^2, ... , ar^n-1 is given by S = a*(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)\n\nApplying this formula to the series we have, T = 1 * (1 - 2^n) / (1 - 2) = 2^n - 1. When n is 2024, T = 2^2024 - 1.\n\nHowever, this calculation uses positive integers and assumes the frog jumps in one direction. But since the frog can jump either left or right, and it has to cover all points from 1 to 2^n - 1, it is not possible for the frog to always make the longest possible jumps.\n\nSo, to cover all points from 1 to 2^n - 1, the frog has to alternate its jumping direction which will effectively reduce the distance it covers in each jump. This means we have to subtract all the distances which the frog could not cover due to alternating jumps.\n\nAssuming optimal strategy, the frog will alternate its jumping direction starting with the longest possible jump. So, it will jump 2^n-1 times in one direction and 2^n-2 times in the other direction, and so on. \n\nThis pattern goes on until the frog has jumped 2 times in one direction and 1 time in the other direction, and this pattern is repeated (2^n-1)/2 times. \n\nThe sum of the lengths which the frog could not cover due to alternating jumps is (2^n-1)*(2^n-1)/2 = 2^(2n-2) - 2^(n-1). \n\nSo, the minimum value of T is 2^2024 - 1 - (2^4048 - 2^2023)\n\n### Answer: 2^2024 - 1 - (2^4048 - 2^2023).",

By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\tv+u=p,(2)\\\\\n\tvu=\\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\\:.$(4)\n\nFrom the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. \n\nSince (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.",

User: Question: Let $p$ be a real number.

            "gpt-4-0613_response": "First, let's move all terms to one side of the equation to have it equal to zero:\n\n$5x^3 - 5(p+1)x^2 + (71p - 1)x + (1 - 66p) = 0$\n\nWe know that all the roots are natural numbers, hence they are positive integers. From Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots equals the coefficient of the second highest power of $x$, divided by the coefficient of the highest power of $x$. \n\nThis means the sum of the roots is $(p+1)$.\n\nSince all the roots are natural numbers and their sum is $(p+1)$, we know that $(p+1)$ must be equal to 3 (as we cannot have more than three natural numbers adding up to a value less than 3, i.e., integers from 1 to 3). Hence, $p = 2$.\n\nNext, we apply Vieta's formulas to the product of the roots taken two at a time: they equal the coefficient of the third highest power of $x$, divided by the coefficient of the highest power of $x$ (with a switch of sign). This gives us $(71p - 1)/5$, which equals $283$ when $p$ is $2$, but the only possible ways two natural numbers can multiply to be $283$ is if they are $1$ and $283$, or $7$ and $41$, none of which add up to $p+1 = 3$.\n\nFrom this, we can determine there is only one possible value for $p$, which is $2$.\n\n### Answer: 2",
