            "answer": "1010\\\\\n\\noindent",
            "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points. Thus, the proposition is proved.",

Thus, $n$ must have at least 6 digits in base 5.\n\nSuppose $n =a_5a_4\\cdots a_0$. The number of carries when adding $n$ and $5^5n$ is the same as the number of carries when adding $a_{5}$ and $\\overline{a_{5}a_{4}\\cdots a_{0}}$. \n\nSince\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\\frac{n}{4}-v_5(n!) &= \\left(\\frac{n}{5}+\\frac{n}{25}+\\cdots\\right)-\\left(\\left[\\frac{n}{5}\\right]+\\left[\\frac{n}{25}\\right]+\\cdots\\right) \\\\\n\t&=\\left\\{\\dfrac{n}{5}\\right\\}+\\left\\{\\dfrac{n}{25}\\right\\}+\\cdots\\\\\n\t&=\\frac{a_{0}}{5}+\\frac{5a_{1}+a_{0}}{25}+\\frac{25a_{2}+5a_{1}+a_{0}}{125}+\\cdots\\\\\n\t&=\\frac{a_5+a_4+\\cdots+a_0}{4}\\\\\n\t&\\geqslant\\frac{a_{5}+a_{0}}{4}\\geqslant\\frac{5}{4}>1\n\\end{align*}\n\n\nThis indicates that in the quintile system $a_5$ and $\\overline{a_5a_4\\cdots a_0}$ are carried at least 2 times, then $a_{1}=4$.

Note that \n\t\\[ \\alpha^{n+2} - \\beta^{n+2} = (\\alpha + \\beta)(\\alpha^{n+1} - \\beta^{n+1}) - \\alpha\\beta(\\alpha^n - \\beta^n) = (\\alpha^{n+1} - \\beta^{n+1}) + (\\alpha^n - \\beta^n), \\]\n\twhich implies $a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n$.\n\t\\item Given the conditions, we know that $b$ divides $\\alpha_1 - 2\\alpha$, i.e., $b | 1 - 2\\alpha$. Since $b > \\alpha$, we have $b = 2\\alpha - 1$. Furthermore, for any positive integer $n$, we have $b | \\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n$, $b | \\alpha_{n+1} - 2(n+1)\\alpha^{n+1}$, and $b | \\alpha_{n+2} - 2(n+2)\\alpha^{n+2}$. Combining these with $\\alpha_{n+2} = \\alpha_{n+1} + \\alpha_n$ and $b = 2\\alpha - 1$ being odd, we get\n\t\\[ b | (n+2)a^{n+2} - (n+1)a^{n+1} - na^n. \\]\n\tSince $(b, a) = 1$, we have $b | (n+2)a^2 - (n+1)a - n$.\n\t\\item By setting $n$ to $n+1$ in the above equation, we get $b | (n+3)a^2 - (n+2)a - (n+1)$. Subtracting this from the previous equation yields $b | a^2 - a - 1$, i.e., $2a - 1 | a^2 - a - 1$. So, $2a - 1 | 2a^2 - 2a - 2$. Since $2\\alpha^2 \\equiv \\alpha \\pmod{2\\alpha - 1}$, we have $2\\alpha - 1 | -\\alpha - 2$ and $2\\alpha - 1 | -2\\alpha - 4$. Thus, $2\\alpha - 1 | -5$, implying $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ or $5$. However, $2\\alpha - 1 = 1$ leads to $b = \\alpha$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $2\\alpha - 1 = 5$, giving $\\alpha = 3$ and $b = 5$.\n\t\\item Now, we need to show that when $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, for any positive integer $n$, we have $5 | (\\alpha_n - 2n\\alpha^n)$. For $n = 1, 2$, we have $\\alpha_1 = 1$ and $\\alpha_2 = \\alpha + \\beta = 1$, so $\\alpha_1 - 2 \\times 3 = -5$ and $\\alpha_2 - 2 \\times 2 \\times 3^2 = -35$, which confirms the condition. Assuming the condition holds for $n = k, k+1$, we can prove it for $n = k+2$ as well. Hence, $\\left(a, b\\right) = \\left(3, 5\\right)$ satisfies the conditions.\n\\end{enumerate}",

Since $a$ and $b$ are both two-digit positive integers, the only possibility for $a$ is 50. Therefore, $a=50$ and $100a+b=5050$.

Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time. From the conclusion, we know that at least one person writes down a smaller number the second time, thus, there must be another person who writes down a larger number the second time, so at least 2 people write down different numbers twice.",

Consequently, starting from the selection of $P_1$, after each point is chosen, Alice can narrow down the range where point $B$ is guaranteed to be by at most $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, after selecting $n$ points, Alice can ensure that point $B$ lies within an area of no less than $\\frac{1}{2^n}$.\n\nIf Alice can guarantee victory, she should be able to cover an area of no less than $\\frac{1}{2^n}$ with a disk of radius $\\frac{1}{2020}$.\n\nTherefore, we must have $\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{2020^2}\\right) < 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2^{20}} = \\frac{1}{2^{18}} = \\frac{1}{2^n}$ when $n=18$.\n\nThus, inequality (1) does not hold.\n\nHence, Alice cannot guarantee victory.",

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$. Consequently, the total number of functions $f$ with a fixed point is calculated as $\\sum\\limits_{c=1}^n(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2=C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.\nAs a result, the number of functions $f$ without a fixed point is found as $C_{2n-1}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-1}=C_{2n-2}^{n-2}$. Therefore, the sought difference is calculated as $C_{2n-2}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-2}=\\frac{1}{n}C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$. In this problem, with $n=10$, the answer is 4862.",

This requires calculating the number of integer solutions of $a+b+c=2005$ where $100 \\leq a,b,c \\leq 999$.### Answer: [The number of sets $(a,b,c)$ that satisfy $S(a)+S(b)+S(c)=M$ is the number of integer solutions of $a+b+c=2005$ with $100 \\leq a,b,c \\leq 999$.

            "reasoning": "For a positive integer $n$, we prove that the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nFirst, we provide an estimation.\n\nInitially, we notice that the frog's jump length must be one of the terms in the set $\\left\\{2^{0}, 2^{1}, \\cdots, 2^{n-1}\\right\\}$; otherwise, it would jump out of bounds.\n\nLet $a_{i}$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$) denote the number of times the frog jumps $2^{i}$ steps. According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.\n\nLemma: For any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n-k} \\leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:\n\n$A-T \\leq 2^{n}-n-1$\n\n$\\Rightarrow T \\geq n$\n\nEquality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nNext, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\\left\\{0,1, \\cdots, 2^{n}-1\\right\\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \\in\\{1,2 n-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, there are two paths: $\\{0,2,1,3\\}$ and $\\{0,2,3,1\\}$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.\n\n(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\\left\\{0,2,4, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\\right\\}$.\n(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\\left\\{1,3,5, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\\right\\}$.\n(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.\n\nTherefore, we can use the path $0 \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-2\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right) \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nIn this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.",

So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. \n\nSince (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.",
