            "reasoning": "First, we prove that $k \\geqslant 1010$.\n\nTake 2019 points on the same line. Obviously, among these 2019 points on the line, at least 2018 of them need to be passed through by a circle.\n\nFurthermore, since each circle can pass through the points on the line at most twice, if $k \\leqslant 1009$, then the number of points passed through by these $k$ circles does not exceed 2018. Note that when equality holds, the first and last points are not contained within any circle, leading to a contradiction.\n\nNext, we strengthen the proof that no matter how these 2019 points are arranged, there always exists a $1010$-good drawing method.\n\nThe strengthened proposition is: \"Prove: there exists a $1010$-good drawing method such that these $1010$ circles pass through the same point.\"\n\nPerform an inversion transformation with a point on the plane not coinciding with any of the 2019 points and not lying on the circumcircle of any three points as the center of inversion. Then, after inversion, to prove the strengthened proposition, it suffices to prove that for any 2019 non-collinear points on the plane, there exist 1010 lines such that each pair of points has at least one line passing through them.\n\nA line is said to \"bisect\" a set of points if the difference between the number of points on each side of the line is either 1 or equal.\n\nLemma:\n\nFor any two sets of points $A$ and $B$, there exists a line $l$ that bisects $A$ and $B$.\n\nProof: The portion of a plane divided by a line is called a half-plane. Obviously, there exists a half-plane containing half of the points in both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $2 \\times$ the number of points in $A$ in the half-plane $-|A| \\leqslant 1$.\n\nIt is evident that there exists a half-plane containing fewer than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a half-plane containing more than half of the elements in $B$ and half of the elements in $A$; there exists a way to rotate and translate the half-plane so that it can be transformed from any half-plane containing half of the elements in $A$ to another, and the route of translation and rotation through half-planes. Therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, the proposition is proved.\n\nA region including a given point is called a figure formed by closed lines, and the modulus of a region is the number of points in the region. Start by connecting a sufficiently large polygon enclosing all the points. Obviously, there is only one region at the beginning.\n\nConsider drawing 1010 lines in order. Consider making each line bisect the two regions with the largest moduli at the moment, defining this as one operation. Next, we prove that this operation can be performed 1010 times.\n\nThe first operation generates a new region, and thereafter each operation generates two new regions. By induction, it is easy to see that the modulus of the region with the maximum modulus is no more than twice the modulus of the region with the minimum modulus, so if there is a region with a modulus of 1, then the moduli of the other regions must be either 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, when the last operation stops, there is at most one region with a modulus of 2 left. Due to parity considerations, there are 2018 regions at this point, and 1009 lines have been drawn. Drawing one more line to separate the two points left in the same region is enough. Thus, it is proved that it is possible to sequentially draw 1010 closed shapes such that no closed shape contains two points. Thus, the proposition is proved.",

Let $u = x - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $v = x + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\nThen, we have\n\n$$\\displaystyle{\\int \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}x + \\frac{1}{2}}{x^2 - \\sqrt{2}x + 1}\\ dx = \\int \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}(u + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) + \\frac{1}{2}}{u^2 + 1}\\ du}$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\displaystyle{\\int \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}x + \\frac{1}{2}}{x^2 + \\sqrt{2}x + 1}\\ dx = \\int \\frac{-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}(v - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) + \\frac{1}{2}}{v^2 + 1}\\ dv}.$$\n\nEvaluating these integrals, we get\n\n$$\\displaystyle{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{1+x^4}\\ dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\pi}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\pi}{2}.}$$\n\nTherefore, the value of the given integral is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\pi}{2}}$."

            "question": "Given an integer $n > 2$. Now, there are $n$ people playing a game of \"Passing Numbers\". It is known that some people are friends (friendship is mutual), and each person has at least one friend. The rules of the game are as follows: each person first writes down a positive real number, and the $n$ positive real numbers written by everyone are all different; then, for each person, if he has $k$ friends, he divides the number he wrote by $k$, and tells all his friends the result obtained; finally, each person writes down the sum of all the numbers he hears. The question is: what is the minimum number of times that someone writes down different numbers? \n\\end{problem}\n\\noindent",
            "answer": "2\\\\\n\\noindent",
            "reasoning": "At least 2 people write down different numbers twice.\n\nLet the $n$ people be denoted as $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$.\n\nConsider the following friendship relationship: $A_{i}$ is a friend of $A_{j}$ if and only if $|i-j|=1 (1 \\leq i, j \\leq n)$.\n\nUnder this friendship relationship, $A_{1}$ writes down the number $1$, $A_{i}$ writes down the number $i+1 (2 \\leq i \\leq n-1)$, and $A_{n}$ writes down the number $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Then after one pass,\n\nthe numbers written down by $A_{2}, A_{3}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ remain unchanged. However, the number written down by $A_{1}$ changes from $1$ to $\\frac{3}{2}$, and the number written down by $A_{n}$ changes from $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nHence, at this point, there are 2 people who write down different numbers twice.\n\nNext, we prove that: at least 1 person writes down a smaller number the second time.\n\nFor each person, define their value as the ratio of the number they wrote down the first time to the number of their friends. Let the value of the person with the highest value among all be $M$.\n\nSuppose person $B$ has a value of $M$, and $B$ has $k$ friends. Then the number written down by $B$ the first time is $kM$, and according to the rules of the game, the number written down by $B$ the second time is at most $kM$. If the number written down by $B$ the second time is smaller than $kM$, then the conclusion holds; if the number written down by $B$ the second time is $kM$, then the value of each of his friends is also $M$.\n\nConstruct a graph $G$, where the vertices are the $n$ people, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the two people are friends. Consider the connected component $G'$ where $B$ is located.\n\nFrom the above discussion, if the conclusion does not hold, then every person represented by a vertex in $G'$ has a value of $M$. Since the degree of each vertex in $G'$ is at least $1$ and at most $|V|-1$ (where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in $G'$), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two vertices with the same degree, which means the two people represented by these vertices wrote down the same number the first time, contradicting the condition. Thus, the conclusion holds.\n\nNote that the sum of the numbers written down by all people the first time is equal to the sum of the numbers written down by all people the second time. From the conclusion, we know that at least one person writes down a smaller number the second time, thus, there must be another person who writes down a larger number the second time, so at least 2 people write down different numbers twice.",

We can use the posterior distribution of $\\Lambda$ to find the predictive distribution:\n\n$$P(N_3 > 1 | N_1, N_2) = \\int_0^{\\infty} P(N_3 > 1 | \\lambda) \\cdot f_{\\Lambda|N_1,N_2}(\\lambda) d\\lambda$$\n\nUsing the Poisson distribution formula, we get:\n\n$$P(N_3 > 1 | N_1, N_2) = \\int_0^{\\infty} (1 - P(N_3 = 0 | \\lambda) - P(N_3 = 1 | \\lambda)) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda^3 e^{-3\\lambda} d\\lambda$$\n\nEvaluating the integral, we get:\n\n$$P(N_3 > 1 | N_1, N_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-\\lambda} - \\lambda e^{-\\lambda}) \\lambda^3 e^{-3\\lambda} d\\lambda$$\n\nUsing integration by parts and other techniques, we get:\n\n$$P(N_3 > 1 | N_1, N_2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$P(N_3 > 1 | N_1, N_2) = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\n### Answer: $\\frac{3}{8}$"

First, using the method of inserting dividers, the number of non-increasing functions is $C_{n-1+n}^{n-1}=C_{2n-1}^{n-1}$. If a function $f$ has a fixed point, i.e., there exists $c$,\nsuch that $f(c)=c$. When the fixed point is $c$, dividing it into two parts $[1,c-1]$ and $[c+1,n]$ and applying the method of inserting dividers again to calculate the number of non-increasing functions, the number of such functions $f$ with a fixed point is obtained as $C_{n-c+c-1-1}^{c-1}C_{c-1+n-c+1}^{n-c}=(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2$. Consequently, the total number of functions $f$ with a fixed point is calculated as $\\sum\\limits_{c=1}^n(C_{n-1}^{c-1})^2=C_{2n-2}^{n-1}$.\nAs a result, the number of functions $f$ without a fixed point is found as $C_{2n-1}^{n-1}-C_{2n-2}^{n-1}=C_{2n-2}^{n-2}$.

Therefore, there is only one valid mapping.\n\nBut there is actually another mapping that is valid, $f(1)=3, f(2)=10, f(3)=1, f(4)=2, f(5)=5, f(6)=6, f(7)=7, f(8)=8, f(9)=9"

            "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of ways to choose 3 points from the vertices of the 17-sided polygon and the number of ways to choose 3 points that form an acute-angled triangle.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 points from the 17 vertices is given by the combination formula:\n\n$$\\binom{17}{3} = \\frac{17!}{3!(17-3)!} = \\frac{17*16*15}{3*2*1} = 680$$\n\nNow, let's consider the number of ways to choose 3 points that form an acute-angled triangle. \n\nWe can use the following approach to count the number of acute-angled triangles:\n\n- The only triangles that are not acute-angled are the ones with one side equal to the side length of the polygon (obtuse triangle) or the ones that are degenerate (collinear points).\n\n- The number of obtuse triangles can be found by choosing one vertex and then choosing the two adjacent vertices. There are 17 ways to choose the first vertex and 2 ways to choose the two adjacent vertices. However, this counts each obtuse triangle 3 times, so we need to divide by 3 to avoid double counting.

A better way to solve the problem is to find the number of non-acute triangles and subtract it from the total number of triangles. We can find the number of non-acute triangles by using the complement principle.\n\nThe only triangles that are not acute-angled are the obtuse triangles and the degenerate triangles. However, as mentioned earlier, the number of degenerate triangles is 0 for a 17-sided polygon.\n\nTo find the number of obtuse triangles, we can use the fact that a triangle is obtuse if and only if one of its sides is equal to the side length of the polygon. We can count the number of obtuse triangles by choosing one vertex and then choosing the two adjacent vertices. There are 17 ways to choose the first vertex and 2 ways to choose the two adjacent vertices. However, this counts each obtuse triangle 3 times, so we need to divide by 3 to avoid double counting.

Since we can't have a fraction of a triangle, we'll round down to 11 obtuse triangles.\n\nHowever, we can't just subtract the number of obtuse triangles from the total number of triangles because some obtuse triangles are counted multiple times. A better way to solve the problem is to find the number of acute triangles directly.\n\nTo find the number of acute triangles, we can use the following approach:\n\n- Choose 3 vertices such that no two of them are adjacent.

There are 17 ways to choose the first vertex and 16 ways to choose the second vertex. However, this counts each non-acute triangle 2 times, so we need to divide by 2 to avoid double counting.

            "reasoning": "For a positive integer $n$, we prove that the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nFirst, we provide an estimation.\n\nInitially, we notice that the frog's jump length must be one of the terms in the set $\\left\\{2^{0}, 2^{1}, \\cdots, 2^{n-1}\\right\\}$; otherwise, it would jump out of bounds.\n\nLet $a_{i}$ ($0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$) denote the number of times the frog jumps $2^{i}$ steps. According to the conditions, we have $a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$.\n\nLemma: For any $k=1,2, \\cdots, n$, we have $a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{n-k} \\leq 2^{n}-2^{n-k}$.\n\nTo prove this, let $m=n-k$ and consider the jump lengths modulo $2^{m}$. We categorize jumps less than $2^{m-1}$ as \"small jumps\" and those greater than or equal to $2^{m}$ as \"big jumps\". It is notable that small jumps change the residue class modulo $2^{m}$, while big jumps do not.\n\nFor each residue class modulo $2^{m}$, the frog can make at most $\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1$ big jumps. Therefore, the number of big jumps is at most $2^{m}\\left(\\frac{2^{n}}{2^{m}}-1\\right)=2^{n}-2^{m}$.\n\nThe lemma is proved.\n\nFor example, when $n=3$: for $k=1$, $a_{2} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{2}$ implies that there can be at most four jumps of length 4; for $k=2$, $a_{2}+a_{1} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{1}$ implies that there can be at most six jumps of length 2 or 4; for $k=3$, $a_{2}+a_{1}+a_{0} \\leq 2^{3}-2^{0}$ implies a total of at most 7 jumps. To achieve the maximum $S$, it is observed that when $a_{2}=4, a_{1}=2, a_{0}=1$, the maximum is attained. Therefore, it is speculated that the maximum value is attained when $a_{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nLet $A=a_{0}+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}-1$, and $T=a_{0}+\\frac{a_{1}}{2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a_{n-1}}{2^{n-1}}$. Then, according to the lemma, we have:\n\n$A-T \\leq 2^{n}-n-1$\n\n$\\Rightarrow T \\geq n$\n\nEquality holds when $a^{m}=2^{m}$.\n\nNext, we use induction to construct two types of paths such that the frog jumps to $\\left\\{0,1, \\cdots, 2^{n}-1\\right\\}$ exactly once, stopping at $x$ where $x \\in\\{1,2 n-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $n=2$, there are two paths: $\\{0,2,1,3\\}$ and $\\{0,2,3,1\\}$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n$, we prove it for $n+1$.\n\n(i) By the induction hypothesis, there is a path from 0 to 2: $\\left\\{0,2,4, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-2\\right\\}$.\n(ii) Similarly, there is a path from 1 to $2^{n+1}-1$: $\\left\\{1,3,5, \\cdots, 2^{n+1}-1\\right\\}$.\n(iii) Connecting these two paths requires one step from 2 to 1.\n\nTherefore, we can use the path $0 \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-2\\right) \\rightarrow\\left(2^{n+1}-1\\right) \\rightarrow 1$.\n\nHence, the minimum value of $T$ is $n$.\n\nIn this question, when $n=2024$, the answer is 2024.",

            "reasoning": "The original expression can be transformed using the principle of place value into: \n\n$$\n(\\overline{a b})^{c} \\times \\overline{a c d}=\\overline{a b c a c d}\n$$\n\nAccording to this equation, where the same letter represents the same digit, and different letters represent different digits, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\nFirst, we consider the case where \\(c=3\\):\n\nSince \\(20^{3} \\times 200=1600000\\), exceeding six digits, we conclude that \\(a=1\\). Thus, the equation becomes:\n\n$$\n\\left[(\\overline{1 b})^{3}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{13 d}=\\overline{1 b 3} \\times 1000\n$$\n\nHowever, since there are 3 factors of 5 on the right side of the equation, and \\(\\overline{13 d}\\) can only provide at most 1 factor of 5, we infer that \\((\\overline{1 b})^{3}-1\\) must be a multiple of 25. This implies that the last two digits of \\((\\overline{1})^{3}\\) can be \\(01, 26, 51,\\) or \\(76\\). By considering the units place, we find that \\(b=1\\) or \\(6\\), but neither of these options satisfies the conditions.\n\nNext, let's explore the case where \\(c=2\\). This yields:\n\n$$\n\\left[(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000}\n$$\n\nFrom this equation, we deduce that:\n\n$$(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1=1000 \\times \\frac{\\overline{a b 2}}{\\overline{a 2 d}}$$\n\nBecause \\(0.5<\\frac{\\overline{a b 2}}{\\overline{a 2 d}}<2\\), we conclude that \\(500<(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1<2000\\). Hence, \\(a\\) can be \\(2, 3,\\) or \\(4\\). However, since \\(\\overline{a 2 d}\\) cannot be 125 or 625, it can provide at most 2 factors of 5. Therefore, \\((\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\) must be a multiple of 5, leading to the possible values \\(b=1, 9, 4,\\) or \\(6\\).\n\nBased on the equation \\(\\left[(\\overline{a b})^{2}-1\\right] \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000}\\), we have:\n\n(1) \\((\\overline{a b}+1) \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000} \\div(\\overline{a b}-1)>1000\\)\n\n(2) \\((\\overline{a b}-1) \\times \\overline{a 2 d}=\\overline{a b 2000} \\div(\\overline{a b}+1)<1000\\)\n\nConsequently, \\(a\\) can only be 3. Then, \\((\\overline{a b}-1) \\times(\\overline{a b}+1)\\) cannot be a multiple of 25, implying that \\(\\overline{a 2 d}\\) must be a multiple of 25. Thus, \\(d=5\\), and \\(\\overline{a 2 d}=325\\).\n\nNow, \\((\\overline{3 b}-1) \\times(\\overline{3 b}+1) \\times 325=\\overline{3 b 2000}\\), where \\(\\overline{3 b 2000}\\) is a multiple of 16. This means that either \\((\\overline{3 b}-1)\\) or \\((\\overline{3 b}+1)\\) must be a multiple of 8. Therefore, \\(b\\) can be 1 or 3. Since \\(a=3\\), \\(b\\) can only be 1.\n\nAfter verifying: \\(31^{2} \\times 325=312325\\), so \\(\\overline{a b c d}=3125\\).",

            "reasoning": "\\\\\n\\textbf{Approach 1}: Since $5 - 5(p+1) + (77p - 1) + 1 = 66p$, $x=1$ is a natural number solution of the original cubic equation. \n\nBy synthetic division, the cubic equation is reduced to the quadratic equation $5x^2 - 5px + 66p - 1=0$(1). \n\nThis problem is transformed into finding all real numbers $p$ such that the equation (1) has two natural number solutions. \n\nLet $u$ and $v(u\\leq v)$ be the two natural number solutions of equation (1). By Vieta's formulas, we have:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\tv+u=p,(2)\\\\\n\tvu=\\frac{1}{5}(66p-1).(3)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom (2) and (3), we eliminate $p$ to get $5uv=66(u+v)-1\\:.$(4)\n\nFrom the condition, neither $u$ nor $v$ can be divisible by 2, 3, or 11. So, $u\\geq 14$.\n\nFurthermore:\nSince 49, $\\nu=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}$.(5)\n$u>66/5$ and $u\\geq 14$ imply $u\\geq 17$.\n\nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u\\geq 17$.\n\nAlso from $\\mathcal{v}{\\geq}u$, we get $\\frac{\\text{66}u-1}{5u-66}\\geq u$.\n\n Thus, $5u^2-132u+1{\\leq}0$, and $u\\leq\\frac{66+\\sqrt{66^2-5}}5<\\frac{132}5$.\n \nSince 2, 3, and 11 do not divide $u$, $u$ can only be 17, 19, 23, or 25.\n\nBy solving (5) when $u=17, 19, 23, 25$, we find that when $u=17$, $\\nu=59$, and both are natural numbers.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 2}: From equation (5) in Approach 1, we get\n $v=\\frac{66u-1}{5u-66}=13+\\frac{u+857}{5u-66}=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{4351}{5u-66}\\right)=13+\\frac15\\left(1+\\frac{19\\times229}{5u-66}\\right)$. \n \n To ensure $v$ is an integer, $5u-66$ must divide 19 or 229. \n \n By considering the prime factors of 19 and 229, we find that $5u-66=19$ when $u=17$, and $5u-66=229$ when $u=59$. Since $5u-66=229$ leads to $v\\notin\\mathbb{N}$, we discard it.\n \n  Therefore, $p=u+v=76$.\n\n\\textbf{Approach 3}: From Approach 1, for equation (1) to have natural numbers as solutions, $\\Delta=25p^2-4\\times5(66p-1)$ must be a perfect square. \n\nAssuming $25p^2-20(66p-1)=q^2$, we get $(5p-132)^2-17404=q^2$. Let $5p-132=m$, then $m^2-q^2=17404$. \n\nThis implies both $m$ and $q$ are even. Setting $m=2m_0$ and $q=2q_0$, we get $m_0^2-q_0^2=4351=19\\times229$. Solving the system of equations derived from $m>q$, we find $m_0=\\pm2176,\\pm124$. \n\nThus, $5p-132=2m_{0}=\\pm4352$ or $248$. From equation (5) in Approach 1, $p$ is a natural number. From (3), we conclude that both $u$ and $v$ are odd. \n\nSince (2) implies $p$ is even, we find $p=76$.",

We can rewrite this equation as $(n_1 - 1)(n_2 - 1) = (71p - 4)/5$.\n\nSince $n_1$ and $n_2$ are natural numbers, we know that $(n_1 - 1)$ and $(n_2 - 1)$ are non-negative integers.\n\nTherefore, $(71p - 4)/5$ must be a non-negative integer.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $71p - 4 \\geq 0$.\n\nSolving this inequality, we get $p \\geq 4/71$.\n\nHowever, since $p$ is a real number, we can also have $p = 4/71$.\n\nWe also know that $71p - 4$ must be a multiple of $5$. \n\nTherefore, $71p - 4 = 5k$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $71p = 5k + 4$.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $p = (5k + 4)/71$.\n\nSince $p$ is a real number, we know that $(5k + 4)/71$ must be a real number.\n\nTherefore, $5k + 4$ must be a multiple of $71$.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $5k = 71m - 4$ for some integer $m$.\n\nSolving for $k$, we get $k = (71m - 4)/5$.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $k = 71m/5 - 4/5$.\n\nSince $k$ is an integer, we know that $71m/5 - 4/5$ must be an integer.\n\nTherefore, $71m/5$ must be an integer.\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get $71m = 5n$ for some integer $n$.\n\nSolving for"
