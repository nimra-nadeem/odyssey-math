{"Problem_5": "### Detailed Problem Analysis\n\nThe problem involves four positive integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) that satisfy the equations:\n1. \\(a^3 = b^2\\)\n2. \\(c^5 = d^4\\)\n3. \\(c - a = 77\\)\n\nWe are required to find the value of \\(d - b\\).\n\n### Key Mathematical Concepts and Techniques\n\n- **Exponentiation and Roots**: The relationships \\(a^3 = b^2\\) and \\(c^5 = d^4\\) suggest that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) are related through their powers, indicating that they might be powers of some common integers.\n- **Difference of Two Squares and Cubes**: The equations can be manipulated using properties of squares and cubes, potentially simplifying the problem.\n- **System of Equations**: Solving this problem involves handling a system of non-linear equations.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze \\(a^3 = b^2\\)\n- Since \\(a^3 = b^2\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be powers of the same base. Let \\(a = x^2\\) and \\(b = x^3\\) for some integer \\(x\\). This satisfies \\(a^3 = (x^2)^3 = x^6\\) and \\(b^2 = (x^3)^2 = x^6\\).\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze \\(c^5 = d^4\\)\n- Similarly, let \\(c = y^4\\) and \\(d = y^5\\) for some integer \\(y\\). This satisfies \\(c^5 = (y^4)^5 = y^{20}\\) and \\(d^4 = (y^5)^4 = y^{20}\\).\n\n#### Step 3: Use \\(c - a = 77\\)\n- Substitute \\(c = y^4\\) and \\(a = x^2\\):\n  \\[\n  y^4 - x^2 = 77\n  \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n- We need integers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) such that \\(y^4 - x^2 = 77\\).
